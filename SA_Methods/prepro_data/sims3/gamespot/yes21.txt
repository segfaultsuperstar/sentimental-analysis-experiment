The/DT first/JJ time/NN you/PRP pick/VBP up/RP The/DT Sims/NNS 3/CD ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ usually/RB under/IN the/DT "/`` Simulation/NN "/'' index/NN ./.
Sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ under/IN RPG/NNP ,/, hell/NNP sometimes/RB it/PRP 's/VBZ in/IN the/DT interactive/JJ dating/VBG section/NN ,/, but/CC not/RB usually/RB otherwise/RB it/PRP 'd/MD put/VB people/NNS off/IN the/DT game/NN well/RB and/CC truly/RB ./.
Unless/IN your/PRP$ a/DT sort/NN of/IN freaky/JJ nerd/NN looking/VBG for/IN some/DT virtual/JJ action/NN ./.
The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ that/IN The/DT Sims/NNP 3/CD is/VBZ n't/RB constricted/VBN to/TO any/DT of/IN these/DT genres/NNS ./.
Nor/CC is/VBZ it/PRP constricted/VBD to/TO any/DT number/NN of/IN hybrid/NN genres/NNS ./.
I/PRP propose/VBP to/TO you/PRP ,/, ladies/NNS and/CC gentleman/NN ,/, that/IN this/DT game/NN is/VBZ n't/RB a/DT game/NN at/IN all/DT ./.
For/IN a/DT game/NN to/TO accomplish/VB this/DT amazing/JJ feat/NN ,/, It/PRP usually/RB has/VBZ to/TO be/VB Call/VB Of/IN Duty/NN Black/JJ Ops/NNS ./.
I.e/NN full/JJ of/IN scripted/VBN sequences/NNS ,/, cut-scenes/NNS and/CC control/NN is/VBZ constantly/RB removed/VBN from/IN the/DT player/NN ./.
Thats/RB right/RB ,/, I/PRP just/RB bad/JJ mouthed/VBD the/DT final/JJ five/CD minutes/NNS of/IN Black/JJ Ops/NNS ./.
But/CC The/DT Sims/NNP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS interactive/JJ game/NN in/IN todays/NNS industry/NN I/PRP hear/VBP some/DT of/IN you/PRP say/VBP ./.
I/PRP may/MD be/VB the/DT first/JJ to/TO notice/VB this/DT but/CC there/EX is/VBZ a/DT fine/JJ line/NN between/IN a/DT good/JJ amount/NN of/IN interactivity/NN ,/, take/VB for/IN example/NN Deus/NNP Ex/FW ,/, and/CC a/DT bad/JJ amount/NN ,/, Battlefield/NN 3/CD 's/POS singleplayer/NN campaign/NN ./.
All/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, The/DT Sims/NNP 3/CD is/VBZ a/DT lighthearted/JJ game/NN ,/, although/IN it/PRP quickly/RB becomes/VBZ a/DT chore/NN for/IN most/JJS things/NNS (/-LRB- SCREW/NN YOU/PRP CHEAP/JJ TOILET/NN I/PRP 'M/VBP NOT/RB CLEANING/VBG YOU/PRP SO/RB MY/NNP SIM/NNP CAN/NNP TAKE/VB A/DT CRAP/NN )/-RRB- ./.

It/PRP was/VBD only/RB six/CD days/NNS ago/IN that/IN he/PRP was/VBD born/VBN )/-RRB- ./.
This/DT game/NN is/VBZ graphically/RB superior/JJ and/CC the/DT game/NN runs/VBZ smoother/JJR ./.
In/IN these/DT final/JJ words/NNS ,/, I/PRP wish/VBP for/IN you/PRP to/TO read/VB carefully/RB ./.
The/DT Sims/NNP 3/CD is/VBZ not/RB a/DT game/NN ./.
The/DT game/NN is/VBZ far/RB to/TO interactive/JJ for/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ own/JJ good/JJ ,/, you/PRP may/MD think/VB that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP I/PRP 'm/VBP saying/VBG and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
But/CC also/RB because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT least/JJS interactive/JJ games/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
After/IN clicking/VBG on/IN a/DT few/JJ things/NNS ,/, you/PRP have/VBP your/PRP$ sim/NN 's/POS list/NN full/JJ across/IN the/DT top/NN of/IN the/DT screen/NN ,/, take/VB a/DT dump/NN ,/, dinner/NN ,/, shower/NN and/CC sleep/VB for/IN about/IN ten/CD hours/NNS ./.
What/WP do/VBP you/PRP do/VB then/RB ./.
If/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ me/PRP I/PRP leave/VBP my/PRP$ computer/NN and/CC get/VB a/DT drink/NN or/CC take/VB a/DT piss/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/TO that/DT ,/, there/EX are/VBP only/RB about/RB five/CD moments/NNS in/IN the/DT game/NN where/WRB there/EX are/VBP exiting/VBG things/NNS happening/VBG ./.
Be/VB it/PRP a/DT fire/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT fight/NN whatever/WDT ./.
However/RB ,/, how/WRB do/VBP you/PRP play/VB The/DT Sims/NNP ,/, do/VBP you/PRP actually/RB watch/VBP everything/NN your/PRP$ Sim/NN does/VBZ like/VB a/DT creepy/JJ stalker/NN ./.
Do/VB you/PRP leave/VB after/IN you/PRP set/VBD his/PRP$ work/NN level/NN to/TO "/`` casual/JJ "/'' ./.
I/PRP ask/VBP you/PRP these/DT final/JJ questions/NNS in/IN hope/NN that/IN you/PRP see/VBP The/DT Sims/NNP 3/CD for/IN what/WP It/PRP actually/RB is/VBZ ./.
And/CC to/TO be/VB honest/JJ ,/, I/PRP have/VBP n't/RB figured/VBD it/PRP out/RP yet/RB ./.
