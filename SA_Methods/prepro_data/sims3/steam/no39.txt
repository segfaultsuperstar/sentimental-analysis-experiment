I/PRP absolutely/RB love/VBP this/DT game/NN and/CC I/PRP 've/VBP wasted/VBN way/NN too/RB many/JJ hours/NNS playing/VBG it/PRP ,/, but/CC why/WRB does/VBZ the/DT DLC/NNP have/VBP to/TO be/VB SO/JJ expensive/JJ ?/.
Especially/RB when/WRB considering/VBG that/IN the/DT next/JJ generation/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN has/VBZ already/RB been/VBN released/VBN ./.
I/PRP understand/VBP offering/VBG additional/JJ content/NN for/IN a/DT little/JJ extra/JJ ,/, but/CC The/DT Sims/NNP 3/CD takes/VBZ this/DT way/NN too/RB far/RB ./.
Either/CC make/VB the/DT expansions/NNS cheaper/JJR or/CC offer/VB more/JJR in/IN each/DT one/CD ,/, because/IN they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB worth/JJ $/$ 20/CD as/IN they/PRP are/VBP now/RB ./.
