Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD for/IN PC/NN has/VBZ shockingly/RB bad/JJ gameplay/NN ./.
The/DT movement/NN controls/VBZ make/VB it/PRP feel/VB like/IN your/PRP$ wearing/VBG mittens/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT way/NN to/TO change/VB the/DT mouse/NN sensitivity/NN ./.
You/PRP can/MD only/RB sprint/VB in/IN perfectly/RB straight/JJ lines/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ absolutely/RB no/DT smoothness/NN to/TO the/DT interaction/NN with/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.
You/PRP would/MD think/VB that/IN there/EX have/VBP been/VBN no/DT advances/NNS in/IN computer/NN games/NNS since/IN ME1/NN came/VBD out/RP ./.
I/PRP love/VBP the/DT characters/NNS ,/, the/DT story/NN ,/, the/DT setting/NN ./.
I/PRP guarantee/VBP you/PRP 'll/MD never/RB see/VB a/DT demo/NN of/IN ME2/NN for/IN PC/NN ,/, because/IN nobody/NN who/WP tries/VBZ it/PRP for/IN an/DT hour/NN would/MD ever/RB buy/VB it/PRP ./.
Maybe/RB the/DT console/NN versions/NNS are/VBP better/RBR ,/, but/CC the/DT PC/NN version/NN is/VBZ a/DT horrible/JJ disappointment/NN ./.
