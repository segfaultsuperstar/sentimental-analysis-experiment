This/DT game/NN is/VBZ fun/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ playthrough/NN --/: only/RB 14/CD hours/NNS on/IN hard/JJ for/IN me/PRP |/SYM and/CC I/PRP did/VBD all/PDT the/DT side-quests/NNS I/PRP could/MD find/VB ,/, personally/RB I/PRP think/VBP that/IN there/EX was/VBD a/DT lack/NN of/IN those/DT ./.
I/PRP very/RB much/RB loved/VBD the/DT first/JJ ME/NN ,/, it/PRP had/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ RPG/NN replay/NN value/NN for/IN different/JJ loot/NN and/CC different/JJ armor/NN types/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT one/CD ,/, that/IN value/NN is/VBZ non-existent/JJ ./.
You/PRP only/RB have/VBP one/CD armor/NN "/`` type/NN "/'' which/WDT you/PRP can/MD upgrade/VB ,/, no/DT armor/NN or/CC shield/NN value/NN differences/NNS really/RB ,/, you/PRP only/RB get/VBP to/TO choose/VB between/IN two/CD different/JJ weapons/NNS of/IN each/DT type/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ obviously/RB superior/JJ in/IN all/DT situations/NNS ./.
It/PRP really/RB posed/VBD no/DT challenge/NN to/TO me/PRP ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP really/RB surprised/VBN that/IN Bioware/NNP would/MD dumb/JJ down/IN this/DT series/NN the/DT way/NN that/IN they/PRP did/VBD ./.
The/DT AI/NNP is/VBZ all-around/JJ stupid/JJ ./.
Your/PRP$ teammates/NNS look/VBP like/IN they/PRP are/VBP in/IN pre-school/JJ compared/VBN to/TO your/PRP$ enemies/NNS ./.
I/PRP wish/VBP I/PRP could/MD actually/RB find/VB someone/NN besides/IN Garrus/NNP and/CC Legion/NNP who/WP know/VBP how/WRB to/TO shoot/VB a/DT gun/NN correctly/RB ./.
The/DT storyline/NN is/VBZ like/IN this/DT -/: gather/VB your/PRP$ team/NN -/: do/VB their/PRP$ sidequests/NNS -/: have/VBP sex/NN with/IN one/CD of/IN them/PRP -/: then/RB go/VB destroy/VB the/DT collectors/NNS ./.
Not/RB really/RB an/DT RPG/NN in/IN my/PRP$ book/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD what/WP I/PRP was/VBD expecting/VBG when/WRB I/PRP bought/VBD this/DT since/IN it/PRP was/VBD in/IN the/DT category/NN of/IN RPG/NN ./.
