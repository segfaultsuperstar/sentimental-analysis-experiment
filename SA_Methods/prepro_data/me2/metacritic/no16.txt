This/DT game/NN is/VBZ like/IN high/JJ budget/NN action/NN movie/NN ./.
Exciting/JJ and/CC visually/RB orgasmic/JJ ,/, but/CC only/RB the/DT first/JJ time/NN around/IN ./.
After/IN that/DT ,/, you/PRP see/VBP past/IN the/DT special/JJ effects/NNS ,/, notice/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ flaws/NNS and/CC decide/VB it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB that/IN great/JJ after/IN all/DT ./.
The/DT worst/JJS part/NN is/VBZ that/IN ME2/NN looks/VBZ exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ on/IN every/DT playthrough/NN ./.
Freedom/NNP of/IN choice/NN or/CC non-linearity/NN ?/.
Forget/VB it/PRP !/.
The/DT only/JJ choices/NNS you/PRP can/MD make/VB are/VBP whether/IN you/PRP want/VBP Shep/NNP to/TO be/VB a/DT jerkass/NN or/CC a/DT slightly/RB nicer/JJR jerkass/NN when/WRB talking/VBG to/TO people/NNS ./.
Even/RB paragon/NNP Shepard/NNP is/VBZ n't/RB really/RB someone/NN you/PRP 'd/MD want/VB to/TO meet/VB ./.
The/DT only/JJ thing/NN I/PRP really/RB liked/VBD about/IN ME2/NN were/VBD the/DT squad/NN members/NNS -/: while/IN they/PRP are/VBP n't/RB exactly/RB nice/JJ people/NNS ,/, they/PRP 're/VBP all/RB well/RB written/VBN and/CC generally/RB likeable/JJ ./.
Overall/RB ,/, ME2/NN is/VBZ a/DT dumbed/VBN down/RP ME1/NN (/-LRB- which/WDT was/VBD hardly/RB a/DT complex/JJ cRPG/NN )/-RRB- stripped/VBN of/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ non/JJ linearity/NN and/CC fitted/VBN with/IN better/JJR graphics/NNS and/CC a/DT more/RBR Gears/NNPS of/IN War/NNP style/NN combat/NN system/NN ./.
Good/JJ for/IN one/CD go/NN ,/, but/CC no/DT more/RBR ./.
