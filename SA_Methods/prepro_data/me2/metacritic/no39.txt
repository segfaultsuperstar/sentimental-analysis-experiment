Hmm/NN ,/, how/WRB should/MD I/PRP begin/VB ?/.
ME1/NN was/VBD a/DT blast/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN ,/, inventory/NN ,/, choices/NNS ,/, teams/NNS ,/, exploration/NN .../: and/CC now/RB in/IN ME2/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT stuffs/NNS that/WDT made/VBD ME1/NN terrific/JJ has/VBZ been/VBN disposed/VBN ./.
And/CC all/PDT those/DT big/JJ gaming/NN magazines/NNS praising/VBG this/DT sequel/NN with/IN 9/10/CD ,/, 94/100/CD like/IN scores/NNS ./. >/JJR
./. >/JJR
I/PRP wonder/VBP if/IN Bioware/NNP actually/RB bribed/VBD them/PRP to/TO give/VB high/JJ scores/NNS to/TO ME2/NN .../: That/DT 's/VBZ why/WRB I/PRP never/RB read/VBP their/PRP$ criticisms/NNS ./.
You/PRP got/VBD ta/TO search/VB for/IN the/DT actual/JJ gamer/NN to/TO have/VB a/DT good/JJ introspection/NN ./.
And/CC majority/NN of/IN the/DT PEOPLE/NNP here/RB would/MD probably/RB agree/VB with/IN me/PRP ,/, as/IN I/PRP agree/VBP with/IN their/PRP$ comments/NNS ./.
ME2/NN is/VBZ far/RB away/RB from/IN being/VBG an/DT RPG/NN game/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRP give/VBP it/PRP 4/10/CD ,/, all/DT for/IN the/DT sake/NN of/IN ME1/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT mixed/JJ comments/NNS about/IN gameplay/NN ,/, graphics/NNS ,/, characters/NNS and/CC such/JJ are/VBP pretty/RB much/RB similar/JJ elsewhere/RB ./.
Mine/NNP too/RB :/: the/DT game/NN is/VBZ short/JJ ,/, the/DT story/NN is/VBZ not/RB well/RB developed/VBN ,/, inventory/NN is/VBZ poor/JJ ,/, choices/NNS of/IN Shepard/NNP does/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB have/VB effects/NNS within/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, but/CC expected/VBD to/TO have/VB effects/NNS in/IN ME3/NN ?/.
You/PRP see/VBP how/WRB Bioware/NNP gets/VBZ away/RB with/IN this/DT ?/.
Thus/RB what/WP I/PRP will/MD add/VB to/TO those/DT nagtive/JJ and/CC mixed/JJ comments/NNS is/VBZ also/RB gon/VBG na/TO be/VB my/PRP$ criticism/NN of/IN Bioware/NNP 's/POS hardline/JJ capitalistic/JJ policy/NN in/IN robbing/VBG people/NNS 's/POS money/NN and/CC stirring/VBG a/DT "/`` mass/NN "/'' anticipation/NN for/IN the/DT third/JJ ME/NN game/NN ./.
Now/RB ,/, they/PRP promise/VBP that/IN if/IN we/PRP buy/VBP those/DT DLC/NNP games/NNS additionally/RB ,/, we/PRP 'll/MD have/VB an/DT idea/NN about/IN ME3/NN -/: DLC/NN PRODUCTION/NN HAS/VBZ BECOME/VB THE/DT VILEST/JJS TACTIC/NN IN/IN THE/DT GAMING/NN INDUSTRY/NN ./.
Keep/VB the/DT game/NN short/JJ and/CC dully/RB ,/, and/CC release/VB some/DT DLCs/NNS and/CC stir/VB up/RP more/JJR anticipation/NN ./.
Surely/RB ,/, gamers/NNS will/MD "/`` buy/VB "/'' it/PRP !/.
With/IN additional/JJ cash/NN flowing/VBG in/IN Bioware/NNP accounts/NNS ...../: Should/MD I/PRP say/VB do/VBP n't/RB buy/VB ME2/NN ?/.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP can/MD ,/, cos/NNS now/RB you/PRP already/RB played/VBD ME1/NN ,/, you/PRP liked/VBD it/PRP ,/, and/CC now/RB you/PRP want/VBP to/TO see/VB the/DT end/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
You/PRP 're/VBP surely/RB gon/VBG na/TO buy/VB ME2/NN ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB linear/JJ and/CC mediocre/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
Because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT bridge/NN to/TO the/DT final/JJ game/NN that/WDT is/VBZ expected/VBN to/TO have/VB very/RB high/JJ climaxes/NNS ./.
And/CC Bioware/NNP will/MD have/VB the/DT cream/NN of/IN the/DT business/NN while/IN experimenting/VBG RPG/NN and/CC FPS/NN with/IN ME2/NN ./.
ME2/NN is/VBZ thus/RB a/DT rather/RB experimental/JJ game/NN and/CC I/PRP hope/VBP that/IN Bioware/NNP takes/VBZ these/DT negative/JJ criticisms/NNS into/IN account/NN ,/, since/IN they/PRP 're/VBP mostly/RB given/VBN by/IN seasoned/JJ ,/, experienced/JJ gamers/NNS !/.
