I/PRP do/VBP not/RB get/VB the/DT love/NN for/IN this/DT game/NN ./.
It/PRP starts/VBZ off/RB good/JJ :/: The/DT Normandy/NNP (/-LRB- minor/JJ spoiler/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ destroyed/VBN in/IN combat/NN by/IN a/DT mysterious/JJ ship/NN ./.
This/DT whole/JJ sequence/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB interesting/JJ ,/, although/IN there/EX 's/VBZ no/DT gameplay/NN to/TO it/PRP ./.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB die/VB ,/, as/IN far/RB as/IN I/PRP can/MD tell/VB ,/, and/CC none/NN of/IN the/DT choices/NNS alter/VBP anything/NN (/-LRB- more/RBR on/IN that/DT later/JJ )/-RRB- ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ cinematic/JJ sequence/NN ./.
After/IN that/DT ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ all/DT downhill/RB ./.
As/IN an/DT action/NN game/NN it/PRP is/VBZ barely/RB adequate/JJ ./.
You/PRP have/VBP some/DT weapons/NNS and/CC abilities/NNS ,/, but/CC really/RB ,/, the/DT variety/NN of/IN different/JJ loadouts/NNS and/CC abilities/NNS in/IN this/DT game/NN is/VBZ similar/JJ to/TO something/NN like/IN Modern/NNP Warfare/NNP 2/CD ./.
A/DT few/JJ guns/NNS ,/, a/DT couple/NN of/IN abilities/NNS .../: that/DT 's/VBZ it/PRP ./.
As/IN an/DT RPG/NN it/PRP is/VBZ very/RB sub-par/JJ ./.
There/EX are/VBP very/RB few/JJ abilities/NNS ./.
Fallout/NNP beats/VBZ this/DT game/NN hands-down/JJ as/IN an/DT RPG/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ nothing/NN like/IN Dragon/NNP Age/NNP or/CC any/DT regular/JJ RPG/NN ./.
Some/DT people/NNS call/VBP it/PRP "/`` dumbed/VBD down/RP "/'' ,/, and/CC that/DT is/VBZ exactly/RB what/WP it/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN ./.
The/DT story/NN is/VBZ ok/JJ ,/, nothing/NN more/JJR ./.
The/DT acting/NN is/VBZ average/JJ ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT time/NN it/PRP just/RB sounds/VBZ like/IN people/NNS reading/VBG lines/NNS ./.
The/DT voice/NN acting/VBG in/IN DA/NNP :O/NNP was/VBD much/RB ,/, much/RB better/JJR ./.
So/RB was/VBD the/DT story/NN ./.
Bioshock/NNP 's/POS story/NN was/VBD far/RB better/JJR than/IN this/DT ./.
This/DT game/NN features/VBZ every/DT stupid/JJ ,/, lame/JJ cliche/NN from/IN science/NN fiction/NN in/IN place/NN of/IN an/DT interesting/JJ story/NN ./.
Beyond/IN that/DT ,/, everything/NN is/VBZ explained/VBN to/TO you/PRP in/IN dialogue/NN ./.
You/PRP are/VBP not/RB allowed/VBN to/TO suspect/VB anything/NN ,/, or/CC wonder/VB about/IN anything/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ all/DT laid/VBN out/RP for/IN you/PRP in/IN an/DT endless/JJ procession/NN of/IN exposition/NN ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB invested/VBN in/IN the/DT characters/NNS at/IN all/DT ./.
I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB know/VB why/WRB I/PRP should/MD care/VB about/IN them/PRP or/CC what/WP happens/VBZ to/TO them/PRP ./.
I/PRP suspect/VBP that/IN how/WRB much/JJ you/PRP like/IN this/DT game/NN depends/VBZ heavily/RB on/IN how/WRB old/JJ you/PRP are/VBP ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP 12-17/CD years/NNS old/JJ ,/, you/PRP 'll/MD probably/RB love/VB this/DT game/NN ,/, because/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT story/NN cliches/NNS and/CC devices/NNS are/VBP not/RB yet/RB boring/JJ to/TO you/PRP ./.
Into/NNP your/PRP$ 20/CD 's/POS and/CC later/RB ,/, this/DT game/NN just/RB looks/VBZ like/IN a/DT mishmash/NN repeating/VBG of/IN all/DT of/IN the/DT plot/NN lines/NNS and/CC elements/NNS you/PRP saw/VBD as/IN a/DT teen/NN ./.
This/DT would/MD be/VB OK/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT story/NN is/VBZ just/RB barely/RB engaging/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT gameplay/NN is/VBZ only/RB barely/RB fun/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT game/NN like/IN Fallout/NNP ,/, the/DT story/NN was/VBD good/JJ and/CC the/DT combat/NN was/VBD pretty/RB good/JJ ,/, although/IN the/DT voice/NN acting/VBG in/IN Fallout/NNP sucked/VBD (/-LRB- except/IN for/IN the/DT professionals/NNS they/PRP used/VBD like/IN Liam/NNP Neeson/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
But/CC the/DT game/NN overall/NN was/VBD engaging/JJ and/CC fun/NN ./.
This/DT game/NN is/VBZ very/RB linear/JJ ./.
You/PRP never/RB end/VBP up/RP in/IN a/DT location/NN exploring/VBG around/RP ./.
It/PRP just/RB never/RB happens/VBZ ./.
You/PRP do/VBP a/DT mission/NN ,/, the/DT mission/NN is/VBZ very/RB linear/JJ ,/, then/RB you/PRP do/VBP another/DT mission/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ also/RB totally/RB linear/JJ ./.
You/PRP upgrade/VBP your/PRP$ four/CD stats/abilities/NNS ,/, upgrade/VBP one/CD of/IN the/DT few/JJ weapons/NNS in/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT 's/VBZ it/PRP ./.
Then/RB you/PRP go/VBP do/VBP another/DT totally/RB linear/JJ mission/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ the/DT "/`` Amusement/NNP Park/NNP "/'' style/NN of/IN games/NNS ,/, where/WRB you/PRP go/VBP from/IN one/CD ride/NN experience/NN to/TO the/DT other/JJ ,/, but/CC nothing/NN connects/VBZ it/PRP all/DT ./.
There/EX 's/VBZ only/RB one/CD significan/NN mechanic/NN in/IN this/DT game/NN other/JJ than/IN moving/VBG and/CC shooting/NN :/: Crouch/NNP Behind/IN a/DT Barrier/NN ./.
You/PRP ca/MD n't/RB even/RB jump/VB ./.
This/DT is/VBZ so/RB silly/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ like/IN going/VBG back/RB to/TO Doom/NN 2/CD ./.
You/PRP get/VBP into/IN combat/NN and/CC guess/VB what/WP you/PRP do/VBP to/TO protect/VB yourself/PRP :/: You/PRP Crouch/NNP Behind/IN a/DT Barrier/NN ./.
Can/MD you/PRP just/RB crouch/NN ?/.
No/DT ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT crouching/NN in/IN open/JJ space/NN !/.
Can/MD you/PRP jump/VB ?/.
No/DT !/.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT jumping/VBG ./.
Well/RB ,/, technically/RB that/DT 's/VBZ not/RB true/JJ ./.
You/PRP can/MD jump/VB ,/, but/CC only/RB .../: yes/UH ,/, you/PRP guessed/VBD it/PRP :/: Jump/NN Over/IN a/DT Barrier/NN !/.
This/DT leads/VBZ to/TO level/NN designs/NNS where/WRB convenient/JJ barriers/NNS are/VBP placed/VBN in/IN strategic/JJ places/NNS so/IN that/IN you/PRP can/MD do/VB the/DT only/JJ thing/NN there/EX is/VBZ to/TO do/VB in/IN this/DT game/NN besides/IN run/NN and/CC shoot/NN :/: Crouch/NNP Behind/IN a/DT Barrier/NN ./.
The/DT review/NN said/VBD the/DT game/NN was/VBD "/`` huge/JJ "/'' ./.
What/WDT ?/.
The/DT game/NN does/VBZ n't/RB feel/VB "/`` huge/JJ "/'' at/IN all/DT ./.
It/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN tiny/JJ little/JJ pieces/NNS that/WDT are/VBP only/RB tangentially/RB connected/VBN ./.
Another/DT sore/JJ point/NN :/: The/DT game/NN is/VBZ full/JJ of/IN dialogue/NN choices/NNS that/WDT are/VBP n't/RB actually/RB choices/NNS ./.
You/PRP have/VBP two/CD options/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN :/: "/`` I/PRP gave/VBD you/PRP an/DT order/NN !/. "/''
and/CC "/`` There/EX 's/VBZ no/DT time/NN to/TO argue/VB !/. "/''
No/DT matter/NN which/WDT one/CD you/PRP choose/VB ,/, the/DT result/NN is/VBZ exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB I/PRP 've/VBP come/VBN across/IN a/DT dialogue/NN choice/NN in/IN the/DT game/NN that/WDT significantly/RB affected/VBD how/WRB the/DT game/NN played/VBD ./.
This/DT is/VBZ not/RB even/RB basic/JJ gameplay/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB the/DT illusion/NN of/IN gameplay/NN ./.
The/DT graphics/NNS are/VBP technically/RB good/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT character/NN designs/NNS are/VBP sometimes/RB very/RB cool/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT environments/NNS does/VBZ not/RB feel/VB real/JJ ./.
It/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN a/DT polished/VBN ,/, computer-game/JJ world/NN ./.
Of/IN course/NN that/DT 's/VBZ what/WP it/PRP is/VBZ ,/, but/CC it/PRP all/DT seems/VBZ so/RB plastic/JJ ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ not/RB compare/VB to/TO Fallout/NNP ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, which/WDT felt/VBD gritty/JJ and/CC real/JJ ./.
It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB even/RB compare/VB to/TO classic/JJ old/JJ BioWare/NNP games/NNS like/IN Baldur/NNP 's/POS Gate/NN ,/, which/WDT had/VBD realistic/JJ and/CC moody/JJ elements/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ like/IN a/DT plastic/JJ world/NN where/WRB everything/NN is/VBZ unnaturally/RB clean/JJ ./.
Does/VBZ n't/RB anybody/NN litter/NN in/IN this/DT universe/NN ?/.
Is/VBZ everything/NN always/RB perfectly/RB spotless/JJ ?/.
I/PRP have/VBP to/TO say/VB that/IN the/DT music/NN is/VBZ fantastic/JJ though/IN ./.
Whoever/WP did/VBD the/DT music/NN deserves/VBZ a/DT big/JJ thumbs-up/NN ./.
I/PRP really/RB thought/VBD this/DT game/NN would/MD be/VB better/JJR based/VBN on/IN the/DT reviews/NNS ./.
If/IN you/PRP are/VBP a/DT teenager/NN ,/, I/PRP suspect/VBP you/PRP will/MD like/VB this/DT game/NN ./.
I/PRP find/VBP it/PRP derivative/JJ ,/, boring/JJ and/CC tedious/JJ ./.
