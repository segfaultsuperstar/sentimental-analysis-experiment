Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD is/VBZ one/CD of/IN my/PRP$ all/DT time/NN favorite/JJ games/NNS ./.
I/PRP will/MD never/RB forget/VB the/DT explosive/JJ ending/NN and/CC all/PDT the/DT amazing/JJ characters/NNS ./.
I/PRP really/RB ca/MD n't/RB say/VB enough/JJ about/IN how/WRB awesome/JJ the/DT game/NN is/VBZ ,/, at/IN least/JJS not/RB in/IN a/DT few/JJ paragraphs/NNS ./.
As/IN my/PRP$ score/NN indicates/VBZ ,/, ME2/NN :/: Arrival/NN was/VBD a/DT major/JJ disappointment/NN on/IN nearly/RB every/DT level/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ an/DT insult/NN to/TO the/DT masterpiece/NN that/WDT is/VBZ ME2/NN ./.
I/PRP think/VBP I/PRP can/MD describe/VB my/PRP$ overall/JJ disgust/NN with/IN Arrival/NN better/RBR algebraically/RB ./.
Do/VBP n't/RB worry/VB I/PRP 'll/MD keep/VB it/PRP simple/JJ ./.
Let/VB (/-LRB- x/NN )/-RRB- =/JJ ME2/NN :/: Arrival/NN and/CC (/-LRB- y/NN )/-RRB- =/JJ Superman/NNP 64/CD ./.
Now/RB ,/, insert/NN (/-LRB- x/NN )/-RRB- and/CC (/-LRB- y/NN )/-RRB- into/IN the/DT algebraic/JJ expression/NN x/NN </JJR y/CD ./.
You/PRP should/MD get/VB this/DT :/: ME2/NN :/: Arrival/NN </JJR Superman/NNP 64/CD Ok/NNP ,/, I/PRP admit/VBP I/PRP 've/VBP never/RB played/VBN Superman/NNP 64/CD ./.
And/CC I/PRP did/VBD give/VB Arrival/NN a/DT 6/10/CD ,/, so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB like/VB it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT complete/JJ waste/NN ./.
(/-LRB- Although/IN it/PRP comes/VBZ about/RB as/RB close/JJ as/IN an/DT asymptote/NN ./. )/-RRB-
The/DT fact/NN is/VBZ ,/, Arrival/NNP has/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ story/NN that/WDT feels/VBZ rushed/VBN ,/, and/CC poorly/RB executed/VBN in/IN nearly/RB every/DT way/NN possible/JJ ./.
It/PRP shows/VBZ that/IN Mass/JJ Effect/NN is/VBZ only/RB great/JJ when/WRB both/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ RPG/NN and/CC 3PS/NN elements/NNS work/VBP in/IN together/RB in/IN tandem/JJ ./.
Arrival/NN 's/POS story/NN surrounds/VBZ a/DT long/JJ lost/VBN Reaper/NN artifact/NN that/WDT warns/VBZ of/IN an/DT "/`` imminent/JJ Reaper/NN invasion/NN "/'' on/IN the/DT entire/JJ galaxy/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT artifact/NN for/IN yourself/PRP ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO rescue/NN who/WP is/VBZ effectively/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS uninteresting/JJ ,/, and/CC worst/JJS acted/VBD characters/NNS in/IN Mass/JJ Effect/NN history/NN ,/, Dr./NNP Amanda/NNP Kenson/NNP ./.
There/EX is/VBZ know/VB reason/NN for/IN Dr./NNP Kenson/NNP to/TO be/VB as/IN blatantly/RB dull/JJ as/IN she/PRP is/VBZ ./.
I/PRP wo/MD n't/RB say/VB much/RB more/RBR about/IN Dr./NNP Kenson/NNP to/TO prevent/VB spoiling/VBG the/DT story/NN ,/, but/CC suffice/VBP it/PRP to/TO say/VB there/EX were/VBD many/JJ opportunities/NNS for/IN character/NN development/NN that/WDT were/VBD not/RB taken/VBN ./.
Arrival/NN tries/VBZ to/TO act/VB like/IN a/DT stealth/NN game/NN for/IN Dr./NNP Kenson/NNP 's/POS rescue/NN ./.
This/DT really/RB is/VBZ n't/RB that/IN bad/JJ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB way/NN to/TO short/JJ and/CC lacks/VBZ character/NN ./.
It/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB at/IN all/DT memorable/JJ ./.
After/IN you/PRP rescue/VBP the/DT boring/JJ Dr./NNP Kenson/NNP ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ off/RP to/TO see/VB the/DT Reaper/NNP artifact/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB fight/VB a/DT series/NN of/IN bland/JJ battles/NNS ,/, to/TO reach/VB your/PRP$ objective/NN of/IN prolonging/VBG the/DT Arrival/NN of/IN the/DT Reapers/NNPS ./.
These/DT battles/NNS are/VBP part/NN of/IN what/WP holds/VBZ Arrival/NNP 's/POS thin/JJ frame/NN together/RB ,/, but/CC when/WRB I/PRP said/VBD they/PRP were/VBD bland/JJ ,/, I/PRP ment/VBP it/PRP ./.
Why/WRB are/VBP the/DT battles/NNS bland/VB ?/.
Because/IN you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB feel/VB compelled/VBN to/TO fight/VB them/PRP ./.
The/DT story/NN is/VBZ so/RB poorly/RB executed/VBN that/IN that/IN these/DT battles/NNS feel/VBP like/IN a/DT chore/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB feel/VBP like/IN they/PRP were/VBD meant/VBN for/IN a/DT straight-up/JJ 3PS/NN ./.
And/CC straight-up/JJ 3PS/NN Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD is/VBZ not/RB ./.
Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD 's/POS combat/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ not/RB perfect/JJ ./.
Since/IN I/PRP pretty/RB much/RB just/RB tore/VBD Arrival/NNP to/TO shreds/NNS ,/, you/PRP might/MD be/VB wondering/VBG why/WRB I/PRP even/RB gave/VBD it/PRP a/DT 6/10/CD ./.
The/DT reason/NN ,/, Arrival/NNP has/VBZ a/DT good/JJ (/-LRB- albeit/IN very/RB thin/JJ )/-RRB- story/NN that/WDT was/VBD executed/VBN horrendously/RB ./.
But/CC in/IN a/DT way/NN ,/, Arrival/NN did/VBD exactly/RB what/WP it/PRP set/VBD out/RP to/TO do/VB ,/, bridge/VB the/DT gap/NN between/IN Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD and/CC 3/CD ./.
I/PRP really/RB think/VBP Arrival/NNP has/VBZ provided/VBN a/DT good/JJ beginning/NN for/IN ME3/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ just/RB a/DT shame/NN the/DT overall/JJ presentation/NN was/VBD so/RB shallow/JJ and/CC sucky/JJ ./.
A/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT cool/JJ in-theory/JJ story/NN ,/, a/DT couple/NN of/IN cool/JJ looking/VBG environments/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT ok/JJ combat/NN warrants/NNS a/DT score/NN of/IN 6/10/CD IMHO/NN ./.
So/RB would/MD I/PRP recommend/VB Arrival/NNP to/TO a/DT Mass/JJ Effect/NN fan/NN ?/.
Yes/UH ,/, but/CC only/RB to/TO bridge/VB the/DT gap/NN between/IN ME2/NN and/CC ME3/NN ./.
To/TO end/VB this/DT review/NN I/PRP 'd/MD like/VB to/TO make/VB a/DT short/JJ plea/NN to/TO BioWare/NNP :/: BioWare/NNP ,/, please/VB do/VBP n't/RB let/VB Mass/JJ Effect/NN 3/CD suck/NN like/IN Arrival/NNP ./.
