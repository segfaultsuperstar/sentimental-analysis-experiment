Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD :/: Firewalker/NNP lets/VBZ you/PRP drive/VB a/DT new/JJ vehicle/NN and/CC will/MD take/VB you/PRP through/IN five/CD missions/NNS full/JJ of/IN fun/NN ,/, action/NN and/CC entertainment/NN ./.
Even/RB though/IN the/DT missions/NNS let/VBP you/PRP see/VB some/DT breath-taking/JJ environments/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP over/IN way/NN too/RB fast/RB and/CC the/DT whole/JJ DLC/NNP has/VBZ n't/RB got/VBD nearly/RB enough/JJ content/NN for/IN anyone/NN 's/POS liking/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT first/JJ mission/NN ,/, compared/VBN to/TO the/DT other/JJ four/CD is/VBZ a/DT bit/NN disappointing/JJ but/CC that/DT is/VBZ understandable/JJ because/IN it/PRP also/RB serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT tutorial/NN which/WDT teaches/VBZ you/PRP how/WRB to/TO use/VB the/DT vehicle/NN ./.
The/DT Hammerhead/NNP (/-LRB- the/DT vehicle/NN )/-RRB- itself/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB fun/NN to/TO drive/VB and/CC while/IN at/IN first/RB ,/, you/PRP may/MD find/VB the/DT controls/NNS a/DT bit/NN clunky/JJ ,/, you/PRP will/MD get/VB used/VBN to/TO them/PRP pretty/RB quickly/RB after/IN about/RB 15/CD minutes/NNS of/IN gameplay/NN ./.
Completing/VBG all/DT five/CD of/IN the/DT Firewalker/NNP missions/NNS takes/VBZ approximately/RB from/IN 1/CD to/TO 2/CD hours/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT DLC/NN ,/, none/NN of/IN the/DT combat/NN takes/VBZ places/NNS on-foot/JJ but/CC you/PRP will/MD get/VB to/TO walk/VB around/IN a/DT bit/NN during/IN the/DT missions/NNS ,/, even/RB if/IN only/RB for/IN a/DT few/JJ minutes/NNS ./.
You/PRP must/MD be/VB wondering/VBG if/IN the/DT Firewalker/NNP mission/NN pack/NN is/VBZ worth/JJ downloading/VBG ./.
Well/RB ,/, considering/VBG the/DT fact/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ free/JJ to/TO download/VB from/IN Bioware/NNP 's/POS website/NN ,/, of/IN course/NN it/PRP is/VBZ worth/JJ downloading/VBG but/CC not/RB as/IN worthy/JJ of/IN playing/VBG ./.
If/IN you/PRP want/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT look/NN at/IN a/DT few/JJ cool/JJ sights/NNS and/CC play/VB around/RP with/IN the/DT Hammerhead/NNP ,/, you/PRP should/MD play/VB it/PRP but/CC if/IN you/PRP are/VBP not/RB interested/JJ in/IN DLC/NNP packs/NNS containing/VBG barely/RB any/DT content/NN and/CC you/PRP do/VBP n't/RB like/VB short/JJ missions/NNS ,/, then/RB you/PRP should/MD pass/VB on/IN this/DT one/CD because/IN you/PRP might/MD consider/VB it/PRP a/DT waste/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
