Arrival/NN is/VBZ the/DT final/JJ installment/NN in/IN the/DT Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD DLC/NN series/NN ,/, and/CC details/NNS the/DT earliest/JJS discovery/NN of/IN the/DT impending/JJ Reaper/NN invasion/NN ./.
Shepard/NNP is/VBZ contacted/VBN by/IN Admiral/NN Hackett/NN (/-LRB- voiced/VBN by/IN the/DT returning/VBG Lance/NNP Hendriksen/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC asked/VBD to/TO rescue/VB an/DT undercover/JJ Alliance/NNP operative/NN from/IN a/DT Batarian/JJ prison/NN in/IN a/DT solo/NN mission/NN ./.
Arriving/VBG on/IN the/DT planet/NN Aratoht/NNP ,/, Shepard/NNP infiltrates/NNS the/DT prison/NN holding/VBG Dr./NNP Amanda/NNP Kenson/NNP ,/, the/DT Alliance/NNP operative/NN held/VBN by/IN the/DT Batarians/NNPS ./.
The/DT player/NN has/VBZ the/DT option/NN of/IN stealthily/RB sneaking/VBG around/IN the/DT guards/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO earn/VB an/DT achievement/trophy/NN ,/, if/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB alerted/VBN to/TO Shepard/NNP 's/POS presence/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ n't/RB immediately/RB obvious/JJ though/IN ,/, and/CC the/DT tendency/NN to/TO stick/VB to/TO the/DT run/NN and/CC gun/NN formula/NN means/VBZ the/DT player/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO miss/VB this/DT first/JJ time/NN around/IN -/: frustrating/JJ considering/VBG you/PRP only/RB get/VBP one/CD shot/NN at/IN this/DT ./.
Negotiating/VBG a/DT few/JJ obstacles/NNS such/JJ as/IN leaking/VBG gas/NN pipes/NNS spewing/VBG flame/NN that/WDT blocks/VBZ your/PRP$ path/NN and/CC the/DT occasional/JJ Varren/NNP ,/, Shepard/NNP eventually/RB breaks/VBZ Kenson/NNP out/IN of/IN the/DT prison/NN ./.
You/PRP then/RB engage/VBP in/IN tense/JJ battles/NNS while/IN making/VBG your/PRP$ escape/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT combat/NN is/VBZ as/IN solid/JJ as/IN ever/RB ./.
Kenson/NNP joins/VBZ you/PRP at/IN times/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT battles/NNS are/VBP usually/RB one-sided/JJ in/IN favour/NN of/IN the/DT enemy/NN owing/VBG to/TO the/DT lack/NN of/IN squad/NN support/NN ./.
Once/RB back/RB at/IN Kenson/NNP 's/POS base/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ revealed/VBN how/WRB they/PRP came/VBD to/TO know/VB of/IN the/DT impending/JJ Reaper/NN invasion/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN to/TO stop/VB it/PRP ,/, they/PRP must/MD destroy/VB the/DT Mass/NNP Relay/NNP for/IN the/DT system/NN they/PRP 're/VBP currently/RB in/IN ,/, albeit/IN at/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN causing/VBG the/DT equivalent/NN of/IN a/DT supernova/NN in/IN the/DT ensuing/VBG explosion/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT destruction/NN of/IN all/DT life/NN Aratoht/NN ,/, an/DT event/NN that/WDT would/MD risk/VB open/JJ war/NN with/IN the/DT Batarians/NNPS ./.
Without/IN wishing/VBG to/TO spoil/VB the/DT plot/NN ,/, Shepard/NNP is/VBZ soon/RB alone/RB ,/, fighting/VBG off/RP waves/NNS of/IN enemies/NNS whilst/IN a/DT countdown/NN begins/VBZ ./.
Another/DT achievement/NN can/MD be/VB gained/VBN by/IN surviving/VBG ,/, but/CC on/IN your/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC being/VBG attacked/VBN from/IN all/DT angles/NNS ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ hard/JJ to/TO find/VB decent/JJ cover/NN and/CC the/DT odds/NNS are/VBP stacked/VBN against/IN you/PRP ./.
Later/RB ,/, Shepard/NNP has/VBZ to/TO complete/VB the/DT plan/NN to/TO destroy/VB the/DT Mass/JJ Relay/NNP ,/, but/CC the/DT events/NNS leading/VBG up/RP to/TO this/DT are/VBP predictable/JJ ,/, given/VBN previous/JJ events/NNS in/IN the/DT main/JJ game/NN ,/, and/CC aside/RB from/IN a/DT neat/JJ touch/NN where/WRB Shepard/NNP remotely/RB controls/VBZ a/DT Mech/NN to/TO break/VB out/RP of/IN confinement/NN ,/, there/EX 's/VBZ a/DT lack/NN of/IN "/`` newness/NN "/'' in/IN terms/NNS of/IN gameplay/NN ,/, a/DT fact/NN that/WDT is/VBZ disappointing/JJ ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, Arrival/NN does/VBZ a/DT decent/JJ job/NN of/IN setting/VBG the/DT stage/NN for/IN the/DT third/JJ and/CC final/JJ game/NN in/IN the/DT trilogy/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP 's/VBZ arguably/RB the/DT least/JJS enjoyable/JJ of/IN the/DT available/JJ DLC/NNP ,/, especially/RB compared/VBN to/TO Operation/NNP Overlord/NNP and/CC Lair/NNP of/IN the/DT Shadow/NNP Broker/NNP ./.
It/PRP feels/VBZ like/IN not/RB much/JJ actually/RB happens/VBZ and/CC whilst/IN fighting/VBG solo/NN has/VBZ its/PRP$ appeal/NN and/CC is/VBZ certainly/RB challenging/JJ ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB shake/VB the/DT feeling/NN that/IN this/DT should/MD 've/VB been/VBN bigger/JJR and/CC better/JJR ./.
There/EX are/VBP three/CD achievements/NNS to/TO be/VB gained/VBN and/CC a/DT couple/NN of/IN upgrades/NNS ,/, but/CC otherwise/RB this/DT feels/VBZ strangely/RB underwhelming/JJ ./.
