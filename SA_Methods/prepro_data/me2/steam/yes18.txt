I/PRP feel/VBP that/IN comparisions/NNS to/TO the/DT original/JJ game/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ when/WRB writing/VBG a/DT review/NN for/IN Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD ,/, so/RB here/RB it/PRP goes/VBZ :/: 1/CD ./.
Like/IN Mass/NNP Effect/NN ,/, Mass/JJ Effect/NN 2/CD is/VBZ a/DT story-rich/JJ 3rd-person/JJ FPS/NNS where/WRB you/PRP play/VBP as/IN Commander/NNP Sheperd/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT story/NN was/VBD not/RB as/IN captivating/JJ as/IN ME1/NN and/CC it/PRP seemed/VBD that/IN I/PRP spent/VBD more/JJR time/NN assembling/VBG and/CC gaining/VBG the/DT loyalty/NN of/IN my/PRP$ crew/NN than/IN on/IN the/DT main/JJ campaign/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN retrospect/NN was/VBD pretty/RB short/JJ and/CC straightforward/JJ .2/NN ./.
The/DT combat/NN system/NN was/VBD an/DT improvement/NN from/IN ME1/NN ,/, where/WRB it/PRP was/VBD much/RB easier/JJR to/TO utilise/VB abilities/NNS (/-LRB- both/CC yours/PRP$ and/CC your/PRP$ squad/NN 's/POS )/-RRB- by/IN binding/VBG them/PRP to/TO the/DT numerical/JJ keys/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, combat/NN got/VBD really/RB repetitive/JJ after/IN a/DT while/NN ./.
The/DT hacking/NN //: bypassing/VBG system/NN was/VBD also/RB an/DT improvement/NN ,/, although/IN mostly/RB unnecessary/JJ and/CC also/RB repetitive/JJ ./.
3/LS ./.
Anyone/NN who/WP played/VBD the/DT original/JJ game/NN would/MD remember/VB the/DT dreadfully/RB long/JJ elevator/NN rides/NNS ./.
Thankfully/RB ,/, ME2/NN had/VBD smoother/JJR transitioning/VBG and/CC also/RB higher/JJR quality/NN cut-scenes/NNS which/WDT were/VBD very/RB enjoyable/JJ .4/NN ./.
Like/IN in/IN ME1/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ to/TO flirt/VB //: develop/VB relationships/NNS with/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN crewmates/NNS ,/, although/IN you/PRP would/MD have/VB to/TO complete/VB your/PRP$ target/NN 's/POS loyalty/NN quest/NN before/IN you/PRP could/MD express/VB interest/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, I/PRP was/VBD disappointed/VBN when/WRB Liara/NN (/-LRB- ME1/NN character/NN )/-RRB- could/MD not/RB be/VB recruited/VBN into/IN my/PRP$ squad/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN she/PRP did/VBD make/VB an/DT appearance/NN in/IN the/DT game.I/NN gave/VBD ME1/NN a/DT rating/NN of/IN 9.5/CD //: 10/CD only/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT elevator/NN rides/NNS ./.
While/IN ME2/NN was/VBD a/DT good/JJ game/NN ,/, it/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB lacking/VBG in/IN story/NN and/CC also/RB its/PRP$ descent/NN into/IN repetitiveness/NN ./.
