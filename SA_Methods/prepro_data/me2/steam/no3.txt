The/DT buying/NN options/NNS on/IN Steam/NN are/VBP misleading/JJ (/-LRB- I/PRP do/VBP n't/RB think/VB this/DT is/VBZ Steam/NNP 's/POS fault/NN ,/, I/PRP believe/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ more/JJR of/IN an/DT issue/NN with/IN how/WRB Bioware/NNP chose/VBD to/TO package/VB their/PRP$ content/NN )/-RRB- ;/: Buying/VBG the/DT "/`` Digital/NNP Deluxe/NNP Edition/NNP "/'' DOES/NNP NOT/NNP include/VBP ALL/NN in-game/JJ content/NN ./.
NONE/NN of/IN the/DT DLCs/NNS are/VBP packaged/VBN into/IN the/DT "/`` Digital/NNP Deluxe/NNP Edition/NNP ./. "/''
And/CC NONE/NN of/IN the/DT DLC/NNP is/VBZ purchasable/JJ on/IN Steam/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ NOT/RB readily/RB apparent/JJ unless/IN you/PRP carefully/RB read/VBD the/DT description/NN on/IN Steam/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, to/TO access/VB the/DT alleged/JJ extras/NNS in/IN this/DT DDE/NN version/NN ,/, you/PRP must/MD make/VB a/DT Bioware/NNP account/NN ,/, find/VB the/DT proper/JJ pages/NNS ,/, download/VB the/DT alleged/JJ extras/NNS manually/RB ,/, and/CC install/VB manually/RB before/IN you/PRP can/MD play/VB them/PRP ./.
