The/DT story/NN in/IN this/DT game/NN is/VBZ good/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT gameplay/NN is/VBZ what/WP kills/VBZ it/PRP for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT areas/NNS you/PRP venture/VBP through/IN are/VBP basically/RB point/NN A/NN to/TO point/NN B/NN with/IN a/DT maybe/RB one/CD or/CC two/CD different/JJ ways/NNS of/IN getting/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT environment/NN looks/VBZ cool/JJ and/CC all/DT ,/, and/CC the/DT game/NN does/VBZ a/DT great/JJ job/NN of/IN looking/VBG like/IN a/DT futuristic/JJ world/NN ,/, but/CC you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB help/VB but/CC feel/VB like/IN you/PRP 're/VBP in/IN a/DT hallway/NN that/WDT leads/VBZ you/PRP to/TO your/PRP$ goal/NN ./.
Which/WDT is/VBZ fine/JJ ,/, but/CC at/IN least/JJS give/VB me/PRP a/DT few/JJ ways/NNS of/IN getting/VBG there/RB ./.
The/DT main/JJ reason/NN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB recommend/VB this/DT game/NN is/VBZ the/DT gameplay/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT story/NN ,/, voice/NN acting/NN ,/, and/CC dialogue/NN are/VBP all/DT great/JJ -/: the/DT gameplay/NN is/VBZ lacking/VBG ./.
Firefights/NNS are/VBP just/RB tedious/JJ and/CC boring/JJ ./.
I/PRP usually/RB use/VBP the/DT sniper/NN to/TO take/VB out/RP the/DT idiot/VBP enemies/NNS further/RB back/RB ,/, then/RB the/DT pistol/NN or/CC assualt/NN rifle/NN for/IN the/DT ones/NNS closer/RBR up/RB ./.
Still/RB the/DT combat/NN is/VBZ so/RB dull/JJ and/CC unchallenging/JJ ./.
I/PRP 'm/VBP sure/JJ it/PRP probably/RB gets/VBZ better/RB later/RB on/IN in/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, but/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP over/IN 6/CD hours/NNS in/IN ,/, and/CC it/PRP just/RB is/VBZ n't/RB doing/VBG it/PRP for/IN me/PRP ./.
The/DT squad/NN abilities/NNS are/VBP cool/JJ and/CC all/DT ,/, but/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN you/PRP can/MD finish/VB almost/RB all/DT firefights/NNS without/IN using/VBG them/PRP at/IN all/DT lets/VBZ you/PRP do/VBP just/RB that/DT ./.
So/IN the/DT abilities/NNS end/VBP up/RP being/VBG flash/NN instead/RB of/IN a/DT necessity/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP little/JJ things/NNS that/WDT bug/NN the/DT hell/NN out/IN of/IN me/PRP ./.
For/IN example/NN if/IN you/PRP decide/VBP to/TO switch/VB to/TO the/DT sniper/NN rifle/NN ,/, but/CC accidentally/RB click/VB on/IN the/DT grenade/JJ launcher/NN ,/, you/PRP have/VBP to/TO switch/VB to/TO the/DT GL/NNP and/CC then/RB switch/VBP to/TO the/DT sniper/NN rifle/NN ./.
Even/RB thought/VBN the/DT game/NN is/VBZ basically/RB paused/VBN ,/, you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB cancel/VB your/PRP$ mis-click/NN and/CC re-click/NN on/IN the/DT weapon/NN you/PRP wanted/VBD to/TO switch/VB to/TO ./.
Then/RB the/DT AI/NN on/IN the/DT enemies/NNS is/VBZ n't/RB the/DT greatest/JJS ./.
They/PRP 'll/MD stand/VB near/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN cover/NN ,/, and/CC you/PRP can/MD easily/RB shoot/VB them/PRP ./.
But/CC instead/RB of/IN moving/VBG away/RB to/TO protect/VB themselves/PRP they/PRP just/RB keep/VBP taking/VBG fire/NN until/IN they/PRP poke/VBP out/RP to/TO shoot/VB or/CC die/VB ./.
Also/RB ,/, they/PRP pop/VBP out/RP to/TO shoot/VB on/IN a/DT timer/NN it/PRP seems/VBZ like/IN ./.
The/DT enemy/NN AI/NN is/VBZ so/RB predictable/JJ it/PRP takes/VBZ away/RP any/DT difficulty.The/NN game/NN is/VBZ positively/RB received/VBN by/IN most/JJS ,/, so/IN you/PRP should/MD probably/RB give/VB it/PRP a/DT shot/NN anyways/RB ./.
But/CC I/PRP just/RB wanted/VBD to/TO share/VB my/PRP$ opinion/NN ./.
Personally/RB I/PRP dislike/VBP the/DT game/NN ,/, but/CC that/DT does/VBZ n't/RB make/VB it/PRP a/DT bad/JJ game/NN ./.
The/DT story/NN ,/, voice/NN acting/NN ,/, characters/NNS ,/, environment/NN ,/, are/VBP all/DT great/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT gameplay/NN leaves/VBZ me/PRP bored/VBN ./.
