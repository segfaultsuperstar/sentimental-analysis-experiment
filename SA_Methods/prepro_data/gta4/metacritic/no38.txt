I/PRP have/VBP not/RB played/VBN the/DT game/NN myself/PRP on/IN PC/NN -/: though/IN I/PRP have/VBP on/IN Xbox/NN -/: but/CC I/PRP have/VBP done/VBN some/DT research/NN on/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, and/CC thought/VBD it/PRP would/MD be/VB good/JJ to/TO explain/VB the/DT likely/JJ reason/NN GTAIV/NN has/VBZ such/JJ low/JJ scores/NNS here/RB ./.
In/IN case/NN you/PRP 're/VBP reading/VBG this/DT and/CC have/VBP n't/RB done/VBN your/PRP$ research/NN ,/, GTAIV/NN for/IN the/DT PC/NN is/VBZ a/DT poorly/RB executed/VBN port/NN and/CC is/VBZ riddled/JJ with/IN glitches/NNS and/CC bugs/NNS ./.
The/DT game/NN is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT 360/CD version/NN ,/, but/CC wait/VB until/IN some/DT patches/NNS come/VBP out/RP to/TO repair/VB the/DT poor/JJ programming/NN !/.
