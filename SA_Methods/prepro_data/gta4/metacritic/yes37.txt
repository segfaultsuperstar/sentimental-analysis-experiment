I/PRP would/MD say/VB that/IN this/DT game/NN is/VBZ much/RB better/RBR on/IN a/DT 360/CD or/CC PS3/NNP than/IN it/PRP is/VBZ on/IN PC/NN ./.
The/DT reason/NN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ short/JJ and/CC simple/JJ :/: Games/NNPS for/IN Windows/NNP ./.
I/PRP respect/VBP Windows/NNP ,/, and/CC I/PRP 'm/VBP running/VBG it/PRP on/IN my/PRP$ computer/NN as/IN I/PRP type/NN this/DT ,/, but/CC one/CD thing/NN is/VBZ clear/JJ :/: they/PRP need/VBP to/TO back/VB the/DT hell/NN off/IN of/IN the/DT gaming/NN market/NN ,/, because/IN they/PRP 're/VBP ruining/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN nice/JJ games/NNS ./.
Some/DT good/JJ examples/NNS :/: Bioshock/NN 2/CD ,/, GTA/NNP IV/CD ,/, The/DT Witcher/NNP ,/, Alone/RB in/IN the/DT Dark/JJ ,/, and/CC many/JJ more/JJR ./.
The/DT Games/NNPS for/IN Windows/NNP seal/NN is/VBZ more/JJR of/IN a/DT curse/NN than/IN anything/NN else/RB ./.
Luckily/RB ,/, I/PRP bought/VBD this/DT on/IN Steam/NN for/IN $/$ 4.99/CD ,/, so/RB I/PRP did/VBD n't/RB waste/VB too/RB much/RB ./.
The/DT game/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, so/IN I/PRP 've/VBP given/VBN it/PRP a/DT 9/10/CD ,/, but/CC Games/NNPS for/IN Windows/NNP has/VBZ nearly/RB rendered/VBN it/PRP unplayable/JJ ./.
God/NNP dammit/RB ,/, Windows/NNP ./.
