I/PRP 'm/VBP reviewing/VBG GTA/NNP 4/CD PC/NN version/NN here/RB ./.
Repeat/NN :/: PC/NNP VERSION/NNP !/.
The/DT only/JJ reason/NN why/WRB Gamespot/NNP gave/VBD this/DT a/DT 9.0/CD score/NN and/CC some/DT other/JJ reviewers/NNS rate/NN this/DT game/NN above/IN 1.0/CD is/VBZ because/IN their/PRP$ judgement/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT console/NN versions/NNS :/: Needless/JJ to/TO say/VB GTA/NNP 4/CD is/VBZ a/DT great/JJ game/NN ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ personally/RB the/DT best/JJS of/IN the/DT GTA/NNP series/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, no/DT matter/NN how/WRB good/JJ a/DT game/NN is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ worthless/JJ if/IN you/PRP ca/MD n't/RB play/VB it/PRP ./.
First/RB I/PRP thought/VBD it/PRP was/VBD my/PRP$ PC/NN ,/, but/CC after/IN reading/VBG Gamespots/NNP review/NN ,/, going/VBG through/IN the/DT forums/NNS here/RB and/CC trying/VBG it/PRP out/RP on/IN different/JJ systems/NNS ,/, I/PRP must/MD say/VB that/IN the/DT game/NN is/VBZ simply/RB a/DT lousy/JJ port/NN ./.
If/IN not/RB THE/DT most/RBS lousy/JJ port/NN ./.
As/IN Gamespot/NNP has/VBZ already/RB reviewed/VBN ,/, the/DT game/NN runs/VBZ terribly/RB even/RB on/IN systems/NNS that/WDT far/RB exceed/VBP the/DT recommended/JJ requirements/NNS ./.
Sure/JJ ,/, it/PRP runs/VBZ ,/, but/CC at/IN far/RB lower/JJR resolutions/NNS and/CC with/IN far/RB lower/JJR settings/NNS than/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ console/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
Then/RB there/EX 's/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN no/DT gamepads/NNS other/JJ than/IN the/DT Xbox/NNP controller/NN will/MD work/VB ./.
After/IN that/DT ,/, the/DT whole/JJ Windows/NNP LIVE/NNP thing/NN is/VBZ just/RB minuscule/JJ ./.
Bottom/NN line/NN :/: GTA/NN 4/CD on/IN consoles/VBZ :/: Game/NN of/IN the/DT Year/NN GTA/NN 4/CD on/IN PC/NN :/: Shame/NN of/IN the/DT Year/NN
