 Before anyone deems "The Sims 2" and "The Sims 3" to be completely "different" games, and as such, The Sims 3 should not be judged based on it's predecessor, you should review the defininition of franchise. The Sims 3 replaces The Sims 2 in terms of funding, that means that EA will finish up whatever it has left for the platform and start funding The Sims 3 instead of The Sims 2. Now this sounds typical, but understand that if The Sims 3 simply built upon The Sims 2 there would be no problem in the transition, but as it is there are many people who are unhappy with the new product, who continue to play with the old and are being pushed aside as EA abandons its old playerbase to form a new one with this release. Honestly, the Sims 1 was a lot more rewarding than The Sims 2... it was more difficult, and items had a more... marked... effect. The Sims 2 was a rewardless sandbox with many features that could have been cooler... the Sims 3 is... something else... I don't even understand what it is suppose to be.
