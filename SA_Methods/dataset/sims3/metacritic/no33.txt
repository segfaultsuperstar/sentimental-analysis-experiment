 I became bored of it within 5 days. The construction part was slightly interesting, albeit with poor graphics. It's basically the level editor section of any other game, except the actual single player is incredibly pointless and painful to watch. You watch a bunch of AI walk around and "interact" with each other. They even give you a fast-forward option, but even at full speed that isn't enough to make it even the tiniest bit interesting. It's a building game. "The Sims" fans -- buy literally any other game (especially FPS) and use the level editor. You'll be like "OH MY GOD, THIS IS THE BEST SIMS GAME EVER"
