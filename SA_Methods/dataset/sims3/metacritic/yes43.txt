 The Sims 3 is by far the best of the series. Essentially everything annoying about the previous game has been removed, and there have been many fun additions to the gameplay. The only reason I'm giving it a 9 is the apparent move to microtransactions, which rubs me the wrong way. There are very few items in-game and most items and articles of clothing cost the equivalent of $0.75 each. Fortunately, you can get most of the good ones with the $10.00 worth of free points when you buy the game. Hopefully the boxed expansions will provide more value.
