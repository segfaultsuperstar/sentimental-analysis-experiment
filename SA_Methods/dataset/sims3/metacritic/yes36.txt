i have the sims 3 from sunset valley to isla paradiso and i want to say that this game rocks! i have many story, many supernatural story, many job story, affair story, many town setting story. the music is great, listening sims music doesn't make you dork at all. i want to recommended this game for people who wants to know who they are: why they are born in this world? what kind music they prefer? what lifetime wish they want? what jobs suit them best? what trait are you?how to befriend someone? how to flirt your partner? how to get promotion? etc. Surely you can not copy what you do on game to real world, there is always different of course but this game is like surface guiding and  i love this game.
