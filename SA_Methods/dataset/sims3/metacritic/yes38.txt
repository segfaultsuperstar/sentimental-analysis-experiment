A masterpiece coming out of the mouth of Electronic Arts. I was dumbfounded by this amazing machinery. The graphics are great, and the voices are clear, so you can hear them. Although there's a bit of graphic content such as WooHoo (sexual intercourse), it's all for the better side. I do think they (Sims) can be a bit annoying and/or dramatic sometimes, but they're only doing it so it's more realistic. During fires, Sims stand up and start to freak out. In real life, you don't always get out of your chair to have a pandemonium tantrum. Other than that, it's a perfect 5 Star game!
