I love the Sims 3. I love it. I have never played the Sims or the Sims 2 so I cannot compare the two. I wanted to play a game where I could take control of someone's life and my friends recommended the Sims. It is very life like with many things you can do. The traits are unique and are plausible. Great game!!
