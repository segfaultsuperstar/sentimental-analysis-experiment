Sims 3? Oh you meant sims 2 with online and  micro transactions. I literally can't tell the difference between the two other than maybe the customization screen, the 3 in the title, and the online. Also, this is a PAY TO PLAY GAME with MICRO TRANSACTIONS. How much money do they need to suck out of your pocket? Not to mention how quickly you get bored of the  thing. 1/10 for the 5 mins of mild entertainment.
