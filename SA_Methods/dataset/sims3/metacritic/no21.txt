I'm a big sims fan.... but Sim3 is a piece of c r a p.I mean there are a few things fine and dandy, some nice innovative things as well.  The seamless zones are great.  But! there are far too many things weighing this game down.  The content in the game is "small".Then I see that you can buy the content for the game for a lot more money via expansions or the STORE.I'm insulted that EA tries this trickery to rape me of my money just because I'm a sims fanboi.This slap in the face is what now makes me wash my hands of this silly franchise, finally.  Sims3 is just boring... boring boring, walk around boring, with no actual content or point to developing your sims, or house.
