 A really fun game - That is if you don't factor in the crashing that thousands of people who absolutely meet the mininum requirements are experiencing (EA has yet to create a path for this... big surprise...), EAs attempts at taking your hard earned cash with overpriced downloadable items. Oh and don't forget the $200 worth of expansions that will be coming soon to slow down your CPU. Your game wont be complete without them! Other than that though... its a fun game.
