 EA has marred this beloved title, turning it into a a creche of progress bars and text boxes, the standard-issue of corporate apathy. Some new design toys for the player are added, as well as the ability to find rocks and do virtually nothing with them;; a glittery paste caving in upon a non-working, disjointed hollow. The Sims 3 is a derelict of titles passed, fully featured with families that don't autonomously show love, limited cross-connectivity between game features, and a total lack of uniqueness in animation and personality variation. Ex: "Evil" sims can "take maniacal naps" which do not even look different. This game is not only a disappointment; it is not only tear-jerking for true fans, it is a completely dangerous standard regression for our youth, who will hardly see their efforts to play creatively be rewarded by unique results, as with previous maxis games. Our young will learn and adopt this standard, bringing us to true idiocracy.
