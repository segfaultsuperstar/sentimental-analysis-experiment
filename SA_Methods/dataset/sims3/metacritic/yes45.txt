 The game is good. It feels like a solid game but is missing a few features that have always been there. The first is the fact that they skimped in some areas where they added it other. Sims don't get in there car any more they just appear in there car or bike about 5 or 6 feet away from the ride. My second issue I found that its one Sim to a neighborhood. You can have as many as you want but you cant work with more then 1 family inside one neighborhood filled with a bunch of family's to pick from. This doesn't phase me all that much but it kinda is an annoyance. I haven't gotten to the point where the kids move out but who knows what will happen then. The last thought I have is how cluttered some of the options are compared to the Sims 2. It just feels to diff rent. I know some people say don't compare it to the Sims 2 but you kinda have to because sequels seek to improve not create something new.
