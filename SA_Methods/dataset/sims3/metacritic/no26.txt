Its a fun game, but too many bugs. You can have the best computer ever, but thanks to the bugs and lag, this game sucks. Then there are the micro transactions. It doesn't matter to EA that you shelled out tons of money for any of the expansions, they still want to charge you more for things that you can not get in the expansions.  So unfortunately, this game is pretty unplayable.
