Glitches, lags and bugs:1. New "stitchless neighborhood" system seems fine at first, but is extremely laggy when used - textures sure like taking their sweet time to load (even on high-end systems) 2. Bugs: objects from one floor above displaying (mid-air) on floors below, families losing their ID (making entire town unable to progress further) etc. 3. Pricy expansion packs, stuff packs and Sims Store content, while few of them actually cost as much; 4. Ridiculous building limitations and many other things I don't want to describe (because it will take a couple of hours) I rate 2 for the effort.
