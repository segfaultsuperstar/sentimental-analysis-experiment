 Ignore the doom-mongerers, this game is such a step up. I was a huge fan of Sims 2 but Sims 3 is miles ahead. Apart from a few things which could be improved (stairs and dropping terrain) the build mode is v intuative and the 'Create Style' option lets you customise almost anything. When it comes to game-play the open neighbourhood is amazing, no more lengthy loads, you can just cruise around town. Sim interaction is improved, there are more skills to learn, things to do and the opportunities addition is a great idea. I'll admit, it took me about a fortnight to make the move from 2 to 3 but now there's no question. Looking forward to great things from the expansion packs!
