The Sims 3 is hands down the strongest in the series.Big open world with so much to do. Sure on lower end PCs it's not the best running game but this sims game alone is a beast.Every Expansion makes the game so huge there's so much to explore and the stuff packs are some of the best.The game is buggy bug with the help of mods it's mostly fixable. It's to be expected with a game this huge and Sims being in real time.So many types of life states you can play as. From things to animals to ghosts, Vampires, Robots, Werewolves, Fairies, etc. (Based off owning all DLC) There's way too much with Sims 3 I poured 1000's of hours into it. It's just too perfect and offers so much.The Car driving, taxi riding, running to places, seeing your sim actually travel to places, etc. It's how a Sims game truly needs to be.Released in 2009 and yet has way too much to do that you end up being sucked in to the world of Sims for countless hours.Many Careers to choose from and even controllable ones.So many traits to choose from even from base game.Amazing moodlet system that feels rewarding in every way and isn't too hard to deal with.Lifetime rewards to challenge yourself.Unlockable Lifetime wishes for rewarding yourself afterwards.A Create-A-Sim that'll keep you making Sims as you keep downloading more and more mods.A never ending "Story Progression" System. When you don't control your Sims they live on their own and can raise families, pass away, travel around, move, etc. It's like they actually can do things players do. And so much more.Sims 3 is the best game there is in the Franchise. No other Sims game can beat it with the amount of Open World and content this game has.
