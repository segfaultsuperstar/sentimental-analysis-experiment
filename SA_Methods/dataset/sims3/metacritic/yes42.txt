This game is way better than the other two. For the graphics, I give it an 8 or 9 out of 10 because the Sims 2 has better graphics. The Sims 3 is great, though. There are so many more things to do and it's more life-like. You can play in the sprinkler, hang out on the tree house, ride your bike to school, and go to the spa. The features are fantabulous. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. It's a must!!!
