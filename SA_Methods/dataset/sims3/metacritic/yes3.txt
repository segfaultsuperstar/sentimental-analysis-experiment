 All I can say is, wow! What an improvement on the last two games! The only thing that set me back is that there were a few items missing (diving board, hot tub, pool table) but like any Sims game they're on their way shortly, and judging by how much i like this one at the moment I'm going to be investing a lot in this title. Its brilliant. Tiny install time and gorgeous graphics. It can be a little confusing with selecting houses and things from the neighbourhood screen (I think it goes without saying the old systems were more simple) but it's a new touch and judging by how you now play the game, it works. You zoom out from your home, mid gameplay, click a restaurant, and within 10 seconds your Sims have responded and are on their way in a cab (or your own, very generous costing car). Behing able to put an object on a table in a grid of 9 rather than just one spot is much more appealing than you'd think. Having a lamp and a pot plant on the same side table puts that little bit more depth into your design.. the capabilities are endless. There is so much humour within the game and the new Sim character design is great, although for some reason the stock heads are awfully wide, it doesnt take much to squeeze the cheekbones in. Skill raising is even more challenging than before and the game has seriously added a whole new lifespan to it with this 3rd title.
