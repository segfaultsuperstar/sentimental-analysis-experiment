 This is hardly sims 3 i would more say sim 2.1. For a start the graphics are rubbish compared to sims 3, the people look odd, its looks so unrealistic and its all and well having all these new destinations just a shame we cant go into them. I personally feel that sims creators are insulting us by selling us this rubbish Â£35. I have been a faithful sims player from day one and saying I'm disappointed is an understatement.
