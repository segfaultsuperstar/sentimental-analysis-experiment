Hard to believe there are only 85 negative reviews.  I have a top of the line gaming system running win 8.1 and an older duo core system running win vista.  Nothing but script errors, random game crashes, bugs, glitches, freezes, corrupted game saves, performance issues, you name it - THIS GAME HAS IT ALL... I'd expect this from a $10 Beta Steam game, not from a known company such as EA.  Very poor programming and patch maintenance.  My daughter was so excited to get the PC version of this game, I spend more time "fixing the game" than she does playing it. Very poor support and programming, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...bottom line.
