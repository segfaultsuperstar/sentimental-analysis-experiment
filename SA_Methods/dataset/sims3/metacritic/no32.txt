 Merely because it is barely a step up from the sims 2. Was a huge disappointment and frankly, Â£35 and about six hours of my life that i'll never get back. the sims look a bit odd, the noses just don't look right, and there is a lack of content. bring out a few well priced expansion packs and i might change my mind. also, it is so SLOW. Not the loading or gameplay, but the actual time goes by so slowly. you have to sit and watch your sims sleep for about ten minutes - and that's not fun.
