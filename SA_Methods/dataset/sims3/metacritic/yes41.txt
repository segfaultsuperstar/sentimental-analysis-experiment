The life simulator perfection at it's finest. I like every single bit of the game - the world, CAS (although I think that the Sims 4 CAS is better, because you can just pick a body part on your sim by your mouse, and change it, for ex. you can just get your mouse on your sims stomach and get it fatter or skinnier), the house creator, the furniture, the clothes, and many more. You don't even really need to get CC for your sims, but if you want to - go ahead. :D
