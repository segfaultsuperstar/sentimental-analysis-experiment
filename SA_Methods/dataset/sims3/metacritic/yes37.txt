OMG! Best Sims game ever! I liked the Sims Bustin Out and Sims 2 on consoles, but I didn't like how there wasn't a huge open world. Luckily, Sims 3 does full justice on that. It's a steal getting it for $19.99, with a very good expansion and the best stuff pack ever made. Highly recommended. Only downside is that trying to stop playing this game is like trying to stop doing a drug, so be careful!
