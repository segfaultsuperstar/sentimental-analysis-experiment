 I have had all the Sims games, but this one at present, seems to be the one I like the least! Personally I find the graphics are nowhere near as sharp as the previous games, and colours less vibrant. - so visually I find it seems messy & incompleted. I liked the simplicity of Sims 2, and some of the quirky add-ons from Sims 1 i.e. Making Magic, shame Sims3 isn't an synergy of the best parts of Sim1 & 2. I may get used to this one - or atleast I'm hoping I will, but for me, the clarity of the graphics is disappointing!
