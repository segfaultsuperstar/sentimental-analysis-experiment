This game is what happens when you mainstream, dumb down, and simplify a well-known franchise.  Nothing really is worth the sixty dollar price tag and I honestly feel robbed and ripped off.  My money might be gone to feed the greedy pigs at EA, but at least I can give my honest feedback of this game here.  Only positive aspect and to start my review, the only redeeming feature is the Create-A-Sim all else falls flat and feels hallow.  Within an hour, I felt bored and just could not get into the game.  I'm a veteran of Sims 1 and 2 and prefer those two in the series.  The core game feels too focused and prioritized on visuals, something the previous games did not need.  What actually let me down and disappointed myself was to see content resisted to The Store, a service on The Sims 3 website which you need to pay to unlock an object.  This is not necessary to hold content from us and having us pay, it feels like theft.  If you take a look at the forums, there is a vast majority who have problems due to bugs and/or glitches and I feel bad for them that they cannot play the game or properly.  This is another problem, bugs and glitches which remain causing problems with the game.  Ah well, I'm sure this new generation of simmers are having a good time because to them graphics only matter mostly and are "sick" and "epic"
