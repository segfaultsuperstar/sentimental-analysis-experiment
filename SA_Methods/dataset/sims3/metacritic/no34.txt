 This game is a major step down from Sims 2 worse graphics, horrible set up, and the cost. $50 dollars for a piece of crap like this, I don't know what i was thinking. And what really T's me off is the part where in order to get all of the content you have to go online and buy gay Sim points to get a bunch of crap that won't work and it cost even more money added to the already outrageously high priced $50 dollars. I will never buy another Sim game again. I'm to the point of disgust with it, it has so many problems. For $50 you would think this would be top of the line, best of ever thing but IT'S NOT. Do NOT get this game. To sum it all up its: high priced, has compatibility issues, comes with bare minimum anout of content, and you have to buy more stuff to go along with it. So just please don't cause yourself to be VERY disappointed and just stay far far far away from this game.
