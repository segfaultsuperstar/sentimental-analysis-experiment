I am a huge fan of TS, and so after TS2, I was really looking forward to 3. Now, when I first started playing TS3, the Base Game, I liked it, but the more I got into the expansions, the less I enjoyed it. The DEVS really dumbed it down. It's less challenging than TS2. The last straw for me was the EP, "Supernatural." Total Garbage. The only thing good about TS3 is Story Progression, but even then, the Sims make poor decisions and rarely follow their Lifetime Wish. Huge disappointment. TS2 still rules the series IMHO.
