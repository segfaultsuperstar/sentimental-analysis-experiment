 I am giving this a 10, because I believe this game really is as good as it gets. I am a huge fan of MMOs, RPGs, Action FPS, RTS - what have you, the normal fare. But every so often games in other genres come along and grab me. This is one. I must be one of the few who never spent a long time on previous Sims incarnations - a bit here and there, so was familiar with the basics but not much more. So I come with a relatively fresh mind; dont really judge it by its history. This is one of those game that really can keep you going til the wee hours of the morning.. the effort reward structure is perfect - always one more thing to achieve. Its funny, and alluring, and entertaining - and creative! The movie mode is golden. Games really do not come better than this. My main concern is this: that certain tools have been denied the user in order to drive a vibrant microtransactions market. But that is not so much a comment on the game, but the revenue model.
