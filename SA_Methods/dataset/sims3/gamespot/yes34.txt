I have played many sim games and its expansion packs. But this game bothers me the most.   Pros   *customisation and create a sim tool has improved from sims 2.  *Graphics are great.    Cons  very high requirments or badly optimised. I use default settings which the game itself suggested to use and everytime i try to move camera the game badly lags. Even if i put graphic setting to low it still lags, my fps is constantly 40- 50. usually in normal games when graphics are changed. it influences fps, but in sims 3 it dosent. i have never seen anything like this. and i can play forexample call of juarez 2 on full graphics, nfs undercover almost high, except aa is turned off. call of duty 4 on medium- high etc. and they never lag!   *Babys are pain in the ass they keep crying  *You can only control one family at a time, you will find out that after a week of playtime it gets very Boring.    Its steam is quickly over, and this is the main reason i give sims 3 so low score!    Summary   Overrated!  Dont buy sims3 unless you are a very big fan. stick with sims2 which is honestly better game!
