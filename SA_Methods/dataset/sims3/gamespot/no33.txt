Take away the 20% of new content - the new graphics = shinier version of the Sims 2.   First off if you have the Sims 2 then your money would be better spent buying one or all the expansion packs for that game. Cause that's what your going to be waiting for with the Sims 3. It'd more of a upgrade for the basic Sims 2 game with no expansions.   EA seems to have just fixed some of the more annoying qualities from the Sims 2, like the ability to move from different house lots without having to reload into another screen.   Basically a very boring game when compared to the Sims 2 and all the add-ons and expansion packs put together. EA really knows how to squeezes people dry when it comes to expansion packs. I look for EA to not disappoint with the Sims 3 and continue releasing similar content like that seen in the Sims 2.Look for the first add-on/ expansion for the Sims 3 to be released some time soon for a not so nicely priced $30 to $60.
