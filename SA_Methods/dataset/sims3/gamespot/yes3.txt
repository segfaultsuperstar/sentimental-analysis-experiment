I liked SIMS 1 and i still think that its the only good game in SIMS series. SIMS 2 was like okay.......not much improvement.   SIMS 3 has massive improvements. Its got amazing graphics. But the gameplay is too slow compared to its predecessors. Yeah there are lots of stuffs to do in this game agreed. But your SIMS keep sleeping all the time and once you have produced a child it is virtually impossible to get a second one. The mood system is broken in this game IMO.   A simple example is that my sim had full enery, had her wishes fulfilled, empty bladder, full stomach. Basically all green, but her mood still was yellow. SIMS 1 though had less features but i rarely remember any feature that was broken.   Maybe its because i am not a hardcore SIMS fan, infact not even a fan. If you are not a SIMS fan and WORSE, if you are trying out a SIMS game for the first time RENT IT. If you are a hardcore fan of SIMS, go for it. You will surely love it as my friend did. Especially don't play this game if you are a guy like me who just completed Prototype on Hard and Gears Of War on Hardcore, this game will be too soft. Just kidding. Though i can't deny that i had real fun creating a Hot Babe who actually looked hot unlike the previous SIMS where inspite of my hard work they all looked average.
