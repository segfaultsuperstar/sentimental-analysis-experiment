It was a total disappointment as I would say. If one were to ever play The Sims 3 on PC, you would be as upset as I would be.   As much as I love to play sims, the DS version was a real disaster. Why? I didn't had any fun creating those characters. I understand that this is a portable game, thus I didn't had my hopes high as my friend had warned me that The Sims in any consoles other than PC pretty much sucks. Yet, those characters were really ugly. Especially the hairstyles. The only possible way to make my character not as ugly was wearing a cap. Whatever happened to the entertainment of creating pretty sims?! Alright, I thought at least the gameplay would entertain me more. However, they actually do not allow users to create a family! You are only allowed to move into a household OR start as single. Another frustration was definitely the camera. It definitely does NOT give you a comfortable view as it makes building your own house, buying your household items,traveling and etc tedious. In a nutshell, The Sims 3 on DS is definitely worst than The Sims on PC. Can it even be considered as part of the Sims? I'm really wondering about this. It wasn't even worth playing for more than an hour. I think EA should really stop producing such products that gives a wrong message to others about The Sims. It was a total waste of time and energy to even download it, not to mention playing it.
