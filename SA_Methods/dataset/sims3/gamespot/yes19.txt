I pre-ordered The Sims 3 expecting another quality sim from the geniuses who made The Sims 2, Maxis. But, wait! What's that looming over the horizon? Oh God no! It's EA. EA is notorious for making gamers pay more for, well, anything! Expansion packs, DL content, less than months after a game is released! This time around, it is lack of content. I was excited to build my new Sim in the game, but I soon found out that i was in a world of hurt. Firstly, The "new and improved Sims" are WAAAY too cartoony compared to the equal balance of cartoony and realistic seen in The Sims 2.  Secondly, the extensive tweaking of body parts is now dumbed down and hidden. Sadly, I can only make a stupid looking Sim that I'm not happy with. More importantly however, Is that there is a lack of hair and clothing.(at least for males) there's about 9 short hair choices and 2 long hair options and then a wide variety of cornrows. I know why this is so. EA launched the "Sim store" where you can purchase things that were purposely left out of the full game. Want a new couch? That will be two (real life) dollars! Most people got their extra content from Modthesims2.com or some other site. Hopefully there will be some sort of CC that will add more hairstyles and less cartoony characters. *sigh* a person can dream, eh?   Gameplay is standard Sim stuff, but with more selection.  Needs are toned down but the game is more complex behind the scenes.   Bottom Line: Wait until the game is $20 and buy $30 of custom content to fulfill a real Sims experience.   oh, and the graphics are kinda "meh" too.
