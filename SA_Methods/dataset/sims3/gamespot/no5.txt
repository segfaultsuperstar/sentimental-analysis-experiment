I purchased this add on from EA when it was released. It never worked. I contacted EA regarding my problem and discovered that my problem was more common than I originally thought. I followed EA's instructions verbatim. Again, nothing. I contacted EA again and they referred me to the Sims 3 forums for assistance. No offense to the extremely talented and knowledgeable forum folks but how about standing behind your product! Then on top of that outrage, the Sims 3 stopped working altogether! EA cannot offer me assistance and will not refund me my $20 that I paid for Barnacle Bay. I've played the Sims since the first game came out and have virtually every expansion pack released for Sims I & II. I would own all of the add ons for Sims III but the game is seriously glitchy. I can understand if I hacked the game somehow or I downloaded some unknown file but that is not the case here. There was no effort made by EA to resolve the problem. I have not played it in months despite wanting to. I just don't need the aggravation.
