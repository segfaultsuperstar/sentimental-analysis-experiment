okay, when i heard this game was coming out for ps3, i literally could'nt hold back my excitement, and i expected this to top all of the other console sims games. And when i got it, I had the dissapointment of my life. There was one thing that really made the sims 2 franchise a huge improvement on the original sims. why? Because direct control was introuced of course!! So why the *** have EA taken a step back and reintrodced the abysmal classic mode?? What possessd them to cock up the game of the decade? It seems all the other reviews on here like direct control, but for amlmost everywhere else on the web, this is not the case.    BUT. before you guys go all troll on my ass, let me tell you, if a direct control dlc were to be released, i would pay any ammount. (literally any amount, even another Â£30) and i would move my rating from a 3 all the way up to a 9. That is all, and disagree if you will, but the fact of the matter is that classic has killed this game, the perfect solution would be a direct control dlc, but it doesnt overwrite the classic mode, it merely stands aside it, that way both classic mode users and direct control users (most of us) would be happy and enjoy the game to its true potential.    So yeah, don't get annoyed with my score, all this needs is drect control and it would be a totally MINT game, and I mean it. That is all.
