This game offers you more bang than your buck's worth. Having three new places to explore (areas mimicking China, France and Egypt)  along with new hairstyles, furniture and clothing to buy (most of their style reflecting on the place your sim has purchased them from) and new skills to learn (photography, kung-fu and wine making), this expansion pack can easily add on around ten hours up of gameplay.    However, there are also plenty of new bugs introduced. Ever since this expansion pack was downloaded on my computer, my entire game (not just the add-on cities) began to suffer from lag. Also, relationship status changes after a visit to one of these vacation points. For example, I had met a girl over in the place who I had liked and had the status as my 'girlfriend', entirely disappeared off my contact list when I went back to Riverville.    All in all, this is a very good game which will make die-hard sims fans take their copies of sims 3 out again. However, to the majority of us who cannot ignore the irksome bugs, I would recommend a pass (you cannot rent this game for it requires the new world adventures disk to play once you downloaded the game...even if you choose not to access the new places).
