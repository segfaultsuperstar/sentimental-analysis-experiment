Despite having Sims for PC, I always have to give it a try on console. I have been disappointed in the past, but as I was so impressed with the Sims 3 for PC, I thought this would be an improvement. I was wrong, I think someone really needs to tell the makers of the Sims to stick to the PC where they create endless fun.  The controls on PS3 are not made to play this game. Moving around locations results in endless loading screens and the 3x time is even very slow. I expected the Sims to be considerably faster on console due to it not being crippled by the rest of the games clogging up my computer, but I was still faced with lengthy loading screens, slow game play and utter disappointment. Creating characters is extremely frustrating and this even appears to be lengthy. Sims games for consoles will never be as satisfying as the ones for PC and will create disappointment amongst many.
