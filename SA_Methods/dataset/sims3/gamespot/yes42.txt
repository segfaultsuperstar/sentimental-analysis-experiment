This is a watered down version of the 360/PS3 game.    Only two areas of the town to visit and only two Sims per household.    3d effect is horrible and the controls take some getting used to.  Since the whole game is controlled by the touchscreen there's really no use for the top screen which isn't a bad thing because the 3d on this game looks really bad. The only time your going to look at the top screen is if you want to see a close up of what your Sim is doing so if your buying this game to see what Sims look like in 3d don't bother. In the end you are still controlling a Sims life and you can still build and decorate hi/her house with a nice number of items to collect. For most people that's all that really matters. If u never played the Sims 3 before, are looking for a huge improvement over the i phone version or just really want a portable Sims game then this is worth buying.
