When the Sims 2 was released, I was a huge fan of the original Sims. However, once I bought Sims 2, I never wanted to play The Sims. The improvement in game play was simply mind-blowing. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the transition from Sims 2 to Sims 3.    A number of elements were added to the game to increase its realism. For example, to cook something, one must go to a general store and buy specific ingredients rather than buying generic groceries and having them delivered. While some might enjoy this, I find it tedious. I also don't like that your characters continue to live while you're playing another family. Again, this may increase realism, but I like to raise each character from childhood, then mix the families to create dynasties. It's not impossible to do this, but it takes a great deal of control away from the user. That may sound a little silly, but it's kind of the point of the game.    There are some things that I like about the game. Fundamentally, it's sound. I like the open environment. I also like that you can control how your character behaves while at work, time that was spent just waiting in previous games. It's also nice that you can customize your sims a little more (for example, there are more than two body types) without downloading content. If I had never played the Sims 2, I would probably love this game. However, while it may be more technically impressive than its predecessor, it's just not as much fun.
