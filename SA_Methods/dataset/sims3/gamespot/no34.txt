After hearing so many stories about the Sims I decided to try for myself.  In the beginning it all looked nice. Character creation is good with plenty of options to choose from.  Then the first steps in my town. At the start when everything you see is new it's nice to play the game.  Until you discover that 98% of the time you are busy to buy and eat food, clean your house, go to bed, go to work. Just as in real life.  I miss what I like in a good game...an escape of real life. I don't want to see real life on my PC screen :P  It could be fun if it was more of a challenge. All Sims are bi-sexual and willing to date or sleep with you. Unless they are to young, to old or married.  Going to work is boring. I expected when I chose to be a Thief that I really could go and steal something. Or being chased by the police.  It's all click and wait till your char is done.  Playing Patience is more exciting then this game.
