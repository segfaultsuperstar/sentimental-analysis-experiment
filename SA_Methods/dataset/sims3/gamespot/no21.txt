This game is far beyond disappointing... for a Sims game, this version is really pathetic. I've tried other versions and none acted or look anything like this.    This game has very, very little effort put into. Did EA even try?! The loading takes forever.The graphics could have been a tad bit better. The controls don't work the way they suppose too.   I also don't expect the town to have every little crack and pebble detailed, but wow... It looks like the video game equivalence of doodling. EA could have done better. Sims 2 pets worked rather well on the wii despite the fact it looks like polygons with cloths, but it's far more detailed and functional than what ever the hell they gave us here. as well as glitchy. I give it credit for at least having a functional OST, but sadly that about the only thing that works    If you want to get Sims 3, I recommend that you get it on any other console that isn't Wii. If it has to be on Wii, get Sims 2 pets, it may not be the same, but at least it works a lot better.
