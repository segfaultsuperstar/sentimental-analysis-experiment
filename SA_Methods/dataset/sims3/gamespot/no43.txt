This expac is difficult to review to be honest.  The gameplay and additions are pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Sims 3 addon but it's a two edged sword.  On the one hand the new interactions etc. are well done and mildly amusing; even if there are not enough of them ( the pack seriously lacks meaningful content).  On the other hand the entire thing is ruined by the sheer amount of game breaking bugs that can crop up.  These bugs vary from mildly annoying graphical glitches to complete meltdown;  On my current game for instance any major item bought from vacations that should appear in the family inventory don't, they are just missing so major areas of the game and the skills associated with them are rendered moot and useless.  I also have a bug where two of my sims will not sleep; they go to bed, start to sleep and are then immediately teleported out of the bed.  This is then rinse, repeated constantly so that particular game is completely broken.   I would hope that EA bring out a patch very soon to address these issues but for anyone thinking of buying Generations I would say hold off until it's working as intended.  For those already playing it do yourselves a favour and uninstall this expac until the patches come down the pipeline.
