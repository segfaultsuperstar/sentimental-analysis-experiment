I think Sims 3 is a great game, I really looked forward to playing it, but I'd rather stick to the Sims 2.   The graphics are great, the music is nice, the whole game is well designed, but when it comes to game-play I must say I'm a bit disappointed. The controlling is too complicated, like I can choose what should my Sim do while he/she is at school (make friends or study harder, etc.) I think this is not necessary. It was just right in Sims 1 and 2, the Sim went to work/school, came home and maybe brought a friend home, maybe not, and if he/she didn't do the homework then they got worse grades. Simple.  Some more things I don't like about the game:  - why does my Sim change to everyday clothes everytime I leave the house? It's annoying  - no hot tubs? Every Sims game had hot tubs so far. And now it's missing.  - the game's system requirements are a bit high. It doesn't have that much graphics and I still have to set the graphics to the minimum for it to run nicely, while for example Modern Warfare 2 runs on max!   The other thing that bothers me is that I can't create an own neighborhood, I have to use the one the game set up for me. Okay, maybe they'll fix this later, but this is still less than the basic Sims 2 game.   I love the CAS (create-a-sim), I can fully customize everything, and the same can be said about building a house. I can choose my own colors, materials, and that's just awesome.   So for Sims 3 I expected a cool game with the graphics and customization ability of Sims 3, but with the simple and great game-play of Sims 2.   And that's why my score is: 6/10.
