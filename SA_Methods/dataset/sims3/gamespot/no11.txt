I've been playing the sims all my gaming life, play it like an addict, bought every single expansion pack from the series.   But Sims 3 really a Blow OFF!   Who ever came up with the idea "House Fire Meter!" is not a gamer at all and sorry to say "idiot move"   Why people play the sims?  We want to BUILD BUILD and BUILD our house, our garden, and soon to be our MANSION!   We want to have biggest pool, greatest garden, lots and lots of fancy furniture without any LIMITATION because the Sims is OUR DREAM WORLD.   but then this HOUSE FIRE METER suddenly LIMITED our imagination and dreams!, broken our eager to be rich and buy more and build more!   who the hell came up with this idea should resign from EA!   sorry to sound very harsh but just try to google "fire meter sucks" and you will find tons of the sims maniac write the same thing!   I will NOT even bother to buy any expansion pack, what's the use if "THE FIRE METER" wont let me ADD another stupid chair or silly pine tree!   I bought the sims 3 and trash it!
