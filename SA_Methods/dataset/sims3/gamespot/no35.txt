I am making a 4/10 ratings on this game because my game crashes every 5-10 minutes of playing. My pc is really fast and I don't know why my pc crashes. Is it because of the PC temperature? EA should make a patch and fix for this, my WoW and other games doesn't crash. My video card is ATI 4870 1gb ddr5 and a 4gb RAM. It's really frustrating because we've been waiting for this game to be launched and here is what we got, a crashing game. This is my only concern, other than that, the graphics and gameplay are fine. I just need to get over this crashing thing. So please, if anyone can help me with this problem, that would be great, the cleaning of video card, updating of drivers doesn't work for me. I have updated directx and video card and still got the same crashing thing. If I get the game to work perfectly, I'll bring back the 10/10 ratings.
