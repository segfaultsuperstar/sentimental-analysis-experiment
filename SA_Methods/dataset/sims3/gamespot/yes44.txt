It's reasonable, i mean it's just a Stuff Pack, but not exactly what i was waiting for. The new items are pretty cool, modern and inspirational for new designs and creations outdoor, but for 15 backs they could add way more items. I personally own every The Sims out there and i make something like a collection, with not any special reason, but if you are not like me or something like a huge fan of the series, you are not losing something EPIC or at least GOOD. The possibilities on The Sims games are endless so I think that the creators had to be more... creative (?) so they can figure out what else they had missed. Either way, if you have a big garden I think its pretty cool for you, but if you don't like outdoor design or you are living inside an apartment thenâ€¦ meh.       ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
