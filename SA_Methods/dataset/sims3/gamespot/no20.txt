the visuals are pretty good  and the modeling too and the 3d effect is great to the eye but the content is not there...  the needs bar is missing and  leads to a great amount of frustration and a disinterest to the game.. you cannot make more than one saved game and you cannot make more than one im and the choices for clothes for your sims  is really bad they could make something more on this one... you are limited to chose some *amount of houses*but result in only you can chose only one in the start of the game with only   18 000$ instead of 20 000$ and when you *go out* in the city you are limited to chose some icons to visit other places that makes the open world a caged world.. the needs bar has been replaced for an icon who appear over your sim's head when he's hungry , exhausted , needing for some toilet or is looking for the shower..  i must say for my own opinion this game is a joke or a unfinished sims game they could put some more effort on this launch and i don't recommend it to anyone.. if you want to waste time of your own  or money go for it!
