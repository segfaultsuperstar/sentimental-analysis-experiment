Always a problem with CC, would not recommend getting any CC from the sims 3 site because they have attached unknown files that could harm your game and make your Sims look awful. If you want to play this game play it without modding and any CC. In my opinion that just makes it boring and especially when the clothing items and hair that come with the game and expansion packs look horrible. Launcher is not user friendly. Game gets boring fast for me now because of the problems it keeps having. The graphics are horrible even if them all the way up and with a fast comp, I just can't stand how much these Sims look like clay. Does not look realistic at all. The expansions that come with this game don't have much and should not cost as much as they do. Sims 2 was reasonable, happy with all the expansions because the items that came with it weren't ugly and were usable. The only way to make this game look good is using CC but can't because it is hard being able to organize it all. If I do decide to play this game again it will be from scratch which is so disappointing because of how hard I worked to fix it up my own way. Praying that Sims 4 will redeem this franchise.
