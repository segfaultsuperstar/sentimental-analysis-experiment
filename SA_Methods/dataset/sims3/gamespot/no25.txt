Quite possibly the biggest letdown of a game I have ever experienced. While I got many hours of enjoyment from the original Sims and Sims 2, I expected the Sims 3 to feature even more content and improve upon the graphical/gameplay mechanics that the other two lacked. After seeing Gamespot give it a proud 9/10 review score, I decided it would be worth putting down the cash to start up another family legacy in what should have been another great Sims sequel. I couldn't have been more wrong.    While most of the Reader Reviews before me have pointed out its major faults, there is one ridiculous problem with this joke of an EA classic that slowly chipped away at my patience and eventually tore me away from the whole series altogether.    Bugs. And when I say bugs, I mean bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs, glitches, crashes, errors, bugs, bugs, bugs, bugs. Your baby that you have been taking care of for 7 days is about to sprout into a sweet little toddler, but alas, the day before his birthday, he mysteriously vanishes and can not be attended to even though you can clearly click on the character pane of an invisible baby. Therefore, child services gets called in and takes your short-lived offspring away. Fantastic.    The invisibility bug seems to be quite a common theme throughout in this seemingly unfinished game that EA decided to unload on its fanbase. Wife about to get that much needed promotion at work? Not happening today sister, because you are about to be teleported out of your office for no apparent reason and get stuck in a door until you keel over and die. Twins trying to finish their homework together? Good luck suckers, because all of a sudden, you both vanish into thin air and end up on opposite sides of town, without any form of transportation back. Playing your guitar out in the park for some tips? Better use that money to buy a new guitar because it too has just randomly disappeared, never to be seen again. And right in the middle of the solo!   Technical support for this game is non-existent as well. Good luck trying to find any useful fixes or patches on the Sims or EA website. They know they released a game basically still in its beta stage, but who cares when you own more than half the gaming industry along with a hefty fanbase that will gobble up any pitiful piece of material you create. Too bad I'm not falling for it anymore. Why bother with any sort of expansion when the initial product isn't even finished?   Honestly, I could go on and on describing all of the ridiculous problems this game manages to spew out. Any sort of fun or interesting game mechanic this game manages to achieve is still overshadowed by the fact that eventually everything you worked toward, like getting max level in your career, building a gorgeous mansion, or marrying the hot chick down the street, will be completely ruined by the game-breaking bugs that manage to find their way into every action you do.   Hopefully I am saving you the trouble of wasting $30-50 and about 10 or so hours of your life. Stay away from this game. The Sims name has been tainted by its evil brother Number 3. Stick to Number 2 or find a better simulation game to play.   (Out of 10)  Overall              3.5   Gameplay         4       -You'll still have a fun time leveling your skills and advancing your career.     Camera control is still awful. Infuriating glitches.   Story                2.5       -The advancing story mode Sims 2 brought to the table is non-existent in this "sequel."   Graphics           3        -In no way does it try to improve upon the Sims 2. In fact, they are worse.   Sound/Music     5       -Some catchy tunes. Voices can be annoying.   Replayabiliy      3       -You can create multiple families, but the lack of available items and building materials, plus only one neighborhood to play in, spells boredom.
