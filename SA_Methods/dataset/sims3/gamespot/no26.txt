The amount of time it takes your sim to fulfill their basic needs the entire day is already gone. Even on my sims days off there wasn't enough time. The amount of sim time it takes to do a take is completely rediculous. It took my sim 4 sim hours to make mac n cheese and eat it, that isn't even counting washing the plate which takes 30 sims minutes. 6 hours isn't even enough time to get your sim ready for work.     Things break too fast. My sim's sink broke so I had them fix it, after they fix it they immediately wash their hand, well when they washed their hands it broke again, fixed it again and it broke again. If you use the toilet 50/50 chance it become completely filthy and has flies over it.    Other sims knock on my door and hang around my porch for what seems days peeing everywhere, but if it is a npc character you made yourself stops by they don't hang around long enough for my sim to stop using the bathroom to talk to them.    It's almost impossible to have your sim work and be remotely happy. There just isn't enough time. I love all sims games including console games but this one is terrible terrible terrible. Kids do not spend your money on this even used, there are much better games out there to spend your cash on. My husband and I collect games, I have never sold a game before but I am selling this one tomorrow. I feel bad for the poor kid who waste their money buying it.    Yes there is only one save file and very very limited items and skills, I was more than happy to ignore all of that just to have a playable sims on a portable console and waited foolishly for my 3ds to purchase this.
