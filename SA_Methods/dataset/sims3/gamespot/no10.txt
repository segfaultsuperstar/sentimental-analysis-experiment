First let me say that I luv the Sims 3, I think it's the best Sims of the series. But, when it comes to this expansion pack, save your money!  Ten bucks, ok, but this was not worth $20. In the digital download I received there were very few new buy items and there were no new build items. Maybe I got jipped in my download. I did not see all of the themes promised. The only lifestyles I saw were racing and classic luxury, the other two (rockabilly & intrigue) just don't seem to be there at all. There is a nice motorcycle (crotch rocket style to compliment the chopper that's already there) and the new car additions are nice but that is not hardly worth $20. High End Loft was much better for adding new content. I think I may try to redownload it again in few days or week to see if my download just was not complete. But if what I got is all you get. It's a rip off.  BTW they did include the new trait of vehicle enthusiast but unless you truly are a car nut that is also a sim junkie you are not going to waste a trait on that.
