I was rather disappointing in this game, it seemed they tried to push this game out before it was finished. The controls where not gamer friendly, Items on walls don't center themselves and you cant delete windows. The wii has a hard time processing the game, the lag is insane, my wi makes all kind of noises, like it's going to explode! Building mode was a pain, you can't see what your putting in the room, since the walls didn't disappear. You have to watch yourself being driven around everywhere, and there's a glitch with your ride to work always being in your driveway. WTF EA games you really dropped the ball! I guess i need to put more characters in so I'll talk about my cat. Her name is Ginger, she's 6 years old and is a tabby cat. It is lame that I have to write filler... The End 8===> 0:
