I LOVE the Sims franchise.  I've been an avid fan for ages, and was excited to see that there were going to go ahead and port it to the home consoles, after I already had my town set and ready to go.  I was enticed with the thought of achievements, and the karma power seemed like it'd be cool...   I won't lie, I still own a copy of "The Sims 2"  for the XBox.  I thought it was cool that you could run around as your Sim, making it nearly effortless to interact with people and objects.  I was hoping maybe they'd keep this same aspect for the Sims 3, but twek it, but they cut it out, and I was okay with that.  It's still completely easy to pick up and play.   The problem I have with it is that, as far as I could see, you couldn't create neighbors, just the househould.  It even tells you before you complete your Sim creation if you only have one made, that making more would "make the game more enjoyable".  I thought this was a little odd, but I figured I would be making neighbors, so one Sim in the house was enough.   In the end, you can't edit or create neighbors.  I looked EVERYWHERE I could.  If I overlooked something, please let me know, but I'm sure it's not there.  And isn't that the appeal of The Sims?  To "Play With Lif3", I believe the box puts it.     I hate to say it, but save your money, unless you're okay with virtually not town customization to speak of.  If you have it on the PC, it's better, look no further for water than the well you have,
