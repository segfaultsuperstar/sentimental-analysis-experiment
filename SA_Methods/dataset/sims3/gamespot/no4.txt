Another month, another expansion or stuff pack. Another missed opportunity to actually solve problems and bugs that are in the game and occupy the players with another batch of objects and minor additions you always feel should have been there in the first place.  Another pack that changes nothing. The innovations are so subtle I wouldn't even tell they are there if the logo shown while the game is loading wasn't different. And the sims, are still so uncomfortable, some actions still take hours for them to start or complete. Time is still the biggest issue. So is the distance - you may be thrilled about the possibility of riding the subway, but them you notice your sim takes two cabs and a subway train just to visit a lot two streets down. You get a car to be able to go to work by yourself, you even live next to the building where your job is, and then your sim has to drive all around the city to get to the destination so close to you. You go to a venue only to get stuck in an elevator and unable to do anything and possibly lose your sim. The bugs are staggering and EA team would have better to get together and solve them rather than to give the players overly expensive packs that give no real change.
