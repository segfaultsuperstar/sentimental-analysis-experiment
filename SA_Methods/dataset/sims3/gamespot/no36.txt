I had high hopes for this game after playing the PC version of sims 3 and owning various other sims on other handheld platforms. I was looking forward to playing a version of Sims 3 with a more adventure based side (like most sims games I've played on handhelds and consoles other than the PC) instead what I got was a scaled down version of the PC version which was lacking certain elements, like creating a family rather than just one sim, the ability for your sims to actually create a family of themselves. You could not purchase certain items in the game to help increase certain skills and the controls were confusing and annoying to work with. The only thing I can commend is the graphics on the game because they were very nice and clean for a handheld version of sims.  After playing this I am going back to the PC version of the game as it allows for the freedom and customisation which I expect from a sims game. Playing sims 3 (3DS) made me feel bored and underwhelmed compared to the PC version and to be fair, other sims games on handhelds.
