When The Sims 3 came out, I thought it would totally exceed my expectations. But really, it's quite an epic disappointment. I'm more or less completely bored when I play this game. I don't know why I bother. I constantly delete my families and start over. And what's with all of the glitches? My computer is less than a year old and equipped with the most up to date technology! I kind of wasted a lot of money on this installment of the series and all of the expansion packs that have since followed. *sigh* The social interactions, building mode, customization, Build-A-Sim features, and anything else you may have previously liked about The Sims and The Sims 2 have been changed and NOT for the better. I have really tried to like this game, but no, it SUCKS. If The Sims 4 were to come out in the future, I'd say don't bother unless Maxis reverts back to its old ways - well, then maybe...
