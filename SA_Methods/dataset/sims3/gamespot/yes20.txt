Don't bother playing the game, if you had enough with sims 2. Sims 3 is exactly like sims 2 including some expansions, and a few new features.   If you were bored by the precious sims, you will be bored by this new one.   If you are a fan of the series, you will enjoy some new stuff for a while, until you get annoyed by one simple fact.   one simple fact that sims producer are and will always miss because of their stubbornness. Same fact that spore missed...   Here is that fact:   ... Sims and spore and all these kind of games in our time are no more single player but massively multiplayer online.   I myself dislike mmorpgs. But when a game's concept has to be a mmorpg, than you have to do it. It is that simple.   so much incompetence, and waste make sims inaccurate of it's time.   for hardcore fans only.
