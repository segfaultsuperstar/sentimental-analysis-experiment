The Sims 3 is a good game if you love simulations. Customization is fantastic allowing you to basically create yourself or anyone. Interacting with other sims can also be a lot of fun. However, the game lacks in the sims intelligence at times. I often allow my sims free will but they sometimes will leave a child crying which is annoying. There are also some things missing from the main game that should've been included without buying DLC. However, despite these flaws, it's still a lot of fun and definitely give it a go.
