This is in no way worth $20!! I looked through basically everything, and the only thing I really liked was the new sport bike and a few of the cars. There are hardly any new items! A few textures, a few clothing and hairstyles, and a new trait... but honestly I couldn't find much more then that.. not even close to how much High End Loft Stuff added. I would pay $5 at most, and only if it was like a downloadable content type thing, not a full-blown stuff pack. Most of the 2.5 GB is updates, and misc. fluff. It was a complete waste, and the typical E.A. hype for this was WAY over-done. There are hardly enough new items to even call it a stuff pack! I'm glad I didn't spend any money for it. It's like throwing our money in the garbage, for all this was worth. GRRR.   All in all, get this for free if you can, but don't spend $20!
