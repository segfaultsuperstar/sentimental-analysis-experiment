HORRIBLE GAME, EA JUST THRW THIS AT US WITH NO FEATURES AT ALL AND IT HAS THIS DUMB STORE. In the game there is almost no furniture at all and you have to buy them from the Sims 3 store or buy MORE EPs , SPs . There are only 5 different hair styles, woopdedoo, that sucks. Only one crappy town and that's it. The game is so damn boring it has no features. EA MAKES US WANT TO BUY THE EPs and SPs . THERE IS NOTHING SPECIAL IN THIS BASIC GAME. I got all the EPs and SPs now to date and the game got a little better but still CMON EA should include some features in the original game at least THIS HAS S**T -    disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, disappointing, .
