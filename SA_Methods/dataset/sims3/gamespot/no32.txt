There are far too many bugs affecting gameplay and story progression...  Important adventure items go missing from inventory, NPC characters disappear, etc.  Although a patch has been released, this game is still infuriating!  The concept is fantastic and I have had a great time playing the adventures until things turned sour. Travelling to Eygpt, China and France is great fun and adventures can be completed with ease but for some reason vital items vanish, aspects relating to the adventures such as people get muddled. I'm going back to the base game or The Sims 2 until things are sorted out.  My advice: wait until they apologise and release a better game!  This game is only for the patient and tech savvy and those who are happy to spend hours reading troublshooting forums to find help!  I wish anyone playing this game now all the luck and patience they can muster!  Did they actually test this game before releasing it?? Don't bother...
