This sims was marketed with all the promises of the sims of pc. they actually showed pc footage in the commercials, just look at the disclaimer at the end that states "footage not representative of actual gameplay". and for good reason. it lacks the "living town" element of the pc version, town editor, and its create-a-style tool is just lacking the customization of the pc. in the console version you could go into a mode called "town editor" this essentially made you a god where you could turn the beach into a resort of sand and swanky cafe and massage parlor, or you could turn the town park into a mega mall, or make a residential lot into a beautiful park. and you could change the entire layout of said town (with exception of the roads). also the load times and cut the town into little slices, removing the idea of jogging to town to go to the gym. while these essential elements took away from the overall feel and joy of the pc version, the fun of making a family and watching them grow and progress through jobs and social interactions is still there, which in my opinion is the saving grace of this title.                      In short if you have not played sims 3 for the pc or mac, buy this title for the xbox.
