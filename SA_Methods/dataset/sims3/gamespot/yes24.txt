I got the hang of it of you have being playing the console version since sims1 you will be glad to know you can go too town now. And have kids again and there is a ageing system you can build a 2nd floor 3rd floor etc. Sadly there is no direct control like sims2 but the cursor is ok. The sims3 can get a bit boring when you don't know what to do because there is no singleplayer it's like a freeplay singleplayer merged tighter because they have wishes which will change their virtual lifes and you can bin the wish or do it giving you life time happiness points to unlock perks for your sim such as being able to miss work be an alclaimed author without out writing the book on the laptop (which u can carry with you) or the computer there is so many things objects in sims3 to make but once u finish your dream in your head it gets boring if can't keep making new ideas your going to sell it. I'm going to list some cool things now cars landscaping (just your lot) moving houses exploring places being able to rob if your a criminal or arrest if your a policeman or woman I suggest u look look up sims 3 features on the web.         If u want the cheat it's press strat in game and hold alll back buttons
