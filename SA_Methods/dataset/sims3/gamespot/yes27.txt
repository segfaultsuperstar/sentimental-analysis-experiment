I have to say, at the beginning i think i was the most excited person. Like "Weeeeheeee!!! Finally Sims 3.". I did a family first, then i have started exploring Sims 3 world. I played 2 or maybe 3 hours. Suddenly i dunno what went wrong. :( But my Sims 3 crashed and my computer shut down.   I have reopened my computer, then began playing Sims 3. It did that again. It's not a wrong version. I have also tried the official version...and it did the same. I have: Windows Vista Ultimate SP1 - 32 bit, Processor: AMD Athlon (TM) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 6000+ [3.10 GHz], RAM Memory:  4.00 GB, HardDisk: 500GB [50GB free] Card Drive: NVIDIA GeForce 9800 GTX/9800 GTX+. And DirectX version is 10.   When i installed Sims 3 i had more memory. I dunno what was the problem. I tried a few days ago and it was all the same. I dunno how to solve this.   Anyway, the game is very nice [excluding bugs - errors]. Maybe you are lucky and it works.
