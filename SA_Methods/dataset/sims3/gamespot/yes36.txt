I have played this game for about 7 hours, and it feels like I've played enough.  It's a big disappointment, especially since I played Sims 2 for more than 30 hours.  This third iteration feels more like an upgrade, rather than something new (or maybe it's just Sims indigestion)   Customization is good, but too limited.  You still wait too long for your sim to finish a task.  EA could have taken the opportunity to add more dynamics to the game, but instead, stayed with the old formula.   One technical note, graphic programming is awful.  I don't understand why a game with so little on the screen is able to task the GPU so much.  I have a Quad Core 6600 equipped with an nVidia GTX 280.  Sims 3 is one of the few games that requires the fan to operate at maximum speed (even at low resolution, such as 1024x768).   I play Burnout, Oblivion, Fallout and other games at a more respectable resolution (min: 1280 x 800, 1680x1050 for Burnout), and never had the fan operated at the speed of Sims 3.  A little optimization is in order.
