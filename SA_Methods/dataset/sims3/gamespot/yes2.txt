Let's face it...there is a lot of skepticism around any sims console title...after all there have been countless iterations of the popular pc simulation game for consoles but few if any actually delivered an experience equal to the pc experience.When I heard that ''The Sims 3'' for wii was supposed to be the full experience I felt a little bit of hope...but as I purchased the game I soon realized that that hope was for lost.          To start off...the sims 3 wii is glitchy...just plain broken,glitchy,buggy and every other word to describe technical flaws...in an average game-play (about 45 minutes) you will experience 6-10 glitches,whether it be inviting someone over,them saying yes but never arriving,mourning a loved ones death when noone you even know has died,foolishly standing around before doing a task...often to end up never doing it,a horribly long wait after abandoning a task,floating bed covers,sim's legs going through the bed during wahoo,and most annoying is the sound glitch which mutes all sims sounds,item interaction sounds and background sounds.For as little as there is in the sims 3 wii it could have at least been glitch free.         Graphically this game is one of the more impressive of wii titles but I start to feel as though it might have been better to have less impressive graphics but a faster game...many times you will freeze in-motion for buildings to load or wonder why you are not able to move when there is nothing in front of you only to soon realize it was an tree or wall that hasn't loaded yet.         From an amount standpoint it is almost as if the developers were being sarcastic when they said this was an experience just as full as the pc version.This game has been stripped down to only the most basic simulation and has been removed of many of the things that made the series great.There are really no more FUN indoor locations to visit,indoor restaurants,clubs,and  the like have been replaced by gyms,libraries,and a handful of (what should be) entertaining locations which actually consist of just seeing your sim walking inside and waiting...and waiting...and waiting.The job-factor is the most entertaining aspect of this title and it feels great to climb your way up the corporate ladder at the job of your choice and see how different actions in-job help you to gain friendly co-workers,promotions,or demotions...but alas even this is cut off by the fairly short work-window in the average sim's lifespan.Yes you can have a job,decorate your home (which is also limited due to the small furniture cap),build relationships as friends or romantic interest (which also usually takes so long you are a very aged sim by the time you are in a full-blown relationship),listen to music,and some of the basic sims activities,but there is no extra effort to make this title unique from the pc version or better at all.              This feels like an incomplete game demo of the sims 3 for pc not an experience that is supposedly ''equal to pc''.There are so many flaws,mistakes,lacking features,and general disappointments about this game that it is almost a disgrace to call it a sims title.If you want a very basic watered down version of the sims then this is the game for you,but if you want a full sims experience stick to the pc version.
