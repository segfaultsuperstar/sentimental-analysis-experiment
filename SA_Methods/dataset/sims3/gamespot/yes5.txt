This DLC contains a new world for The Sims 3. Lucky Palms is a Las Vegas themed world. Most of it is desert, but there are places in the world that are meant to resemble houses that you would find near a fancy golf course. There's also an area that looks like a wharf or dock, with some very cute little houses that look like house boats (though they are technically just houses on decks). However, most of the other houses in this town are huge and their layouts are terrible for everyday gameplay. Bathrooms are located in the back of the house near nothing, houses have giant patios in the center of the home that sims have to walk through to get to the other part of the house, etc. At least everything in this world looks nice and fits the Vegas town theme appropriately. There seem to be plenty of empty, sizeable lots of you want to add your own venues or homes.    If you get the "gold" version of the world, it comes with a casino that has slot machines and a blackjack table. The gold version and the regular version both contain a functional wishing well.    Most of this is great, but even on sale, this world costs 2100 "Simpoints" for the standard version, and 3700 Simpoints for the gold version. This comes out to $21 and $37, respectively. Since you can't just purchase these for cash, you wind up having to buy more Simpoints than you need, so you have to spend more to get these items.
