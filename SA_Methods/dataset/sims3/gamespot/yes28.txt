The Sims 3: High-End Loft Stuff is just like what EA did with the Sims 2; they released "stuff packs" that offered some interesting objects and clothing. High-End Loft Stuff is the first stuff pack for The Sims 3.   This stuff pack offers some good content that can be used for your houses and sims. These objects included futuristic beds, bigger televisions and so on. But these objects aren't going to get much use if your starting out with a new Sim or family (unless you use cheats of course!). Or maybe if your bored with the objects that came with the base game, this might be a good investment.   The Sims 3 Store offers alot of downloadable content too but High-End Loft Stuff is useful for people who dont have access to the internet, or have a turtle-slow Internet! But nowadays, nearly everyone has access to the Internet.   So to sum up everything, The Sims 3: High-End Loft Stuff pack offers some good content if your looking to update your games content, but for its price and lack of new things to do, EA would have been better off putting the content on the Sims 3 Store.
