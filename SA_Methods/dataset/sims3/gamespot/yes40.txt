Don't take me wrong, the game is fun! It just does not have enough to offer to the game play itself. I was exited for this game and I still play it now, but there could be so much more to the game than there is. The carriers are great and the feature of you designing your own stage is fun. There are a lot of Create-A-Style objects in this game (hairstyles, clothes) and even more if you get the Katy Perry limited edition, but the stability of the game has gone down dramatically. I have never experienced my game crashing before Showtime but now my game crashes now and then. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you have worked hard on your carriers and the game crashes - you lose everything and have to start over. It got to the point, where i had to use cheats to make my carier go back to the level it was. The town it comes with has the whole "Hollywood" feel to it and it is enjoyable, but i found myself going back to Bridgeport after a while. This expansion pack is in my top 5 and it fits snuggly in #4. My #1 is still Late Night and I don't know what EA will do to top that game.  Go out and buy this game if you like the idea of stardome, but I can't wait for a middle-class expansion pack without the whole " fancy" aspect to it. :)
