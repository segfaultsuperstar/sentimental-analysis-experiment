A year on from the pc version, The Sims 3 has finally been released on consoles. But it is really not worth the wait and I will certainly be putting it away in a cupboard for many years.   I understand that many people had to wait for The Sims 3 to come out on console as it asked for too much from the computer but what we've been force-fed is a watered-down, extremely linear version of the game.             The biggest change in the game was having the ability to take control of the whole neighbourhood but this is missing in the console version. Instead, you can have up to 3 houses on screen but will have to endure those dreaded loading times when moving to new areas of the town. Also, the graphics are very blurry and the detail of the sims is dreadful. Available objects to buy are of little choice and the customisation options are just stupid and tedious.              When you go to work you can see your sim go into the work place but you can't see inside the workplace. You are also unable to see inside the shops when you could in the Sims 2. And glitches, well, firstly, when you go to save there is a high chance of your game crashing and you therefore lose all data. Also, there is no super-speed option so when your sims are asleep or at work, you are left twiddling your thumbs for 10 minutes.              There are no expansion packs for the console version and so the game feels very empty compared to the pc version. And this game is even worse than The Sims 2 Console Version which was very average in itself.   Overall, The Sims 3 console version is a very poorly created game and will surely put many Sims fans off of the game series. I'm one of them.
