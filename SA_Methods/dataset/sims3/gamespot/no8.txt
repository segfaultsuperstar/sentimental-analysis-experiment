Summary:  Prepare to be BORED OUT OF YOUR MIND!  Experience life as a pethetic and boring dweeb!  Interact with other dweebs.  Make your dweeb get a job, cook, and go swimming.  Huh?  Why is that fun again?   I heard so much about how addictive the SIMs games are, so I decided to give it a shot.   I've discovered that I'm not a "SIMS" person.  I like strategy games like Civilization, Rise of Nations...  I like mindlessly fun shooters like Gears of War.  I liked the original F.E.A.R.  I liked Prototype, Crysis, Far Cry, etc.  But I simply don't get these SIMs.  I'd rather just step outside than sit in front of a computer and direct a SIM to go outside.  What's the point of the SIMs again?   I was expecting some kind of a feedback system that would make the hours I spent playing worth it...  But the satisfaction never came.  If all I wanted was to control a dimwit, I'd go find a dimwit and manipulate the hell out of them.  Not that I'd do that, but then again, I'll never play one of these mind-numbingly pointless games again either.   Horr-i-ble!
