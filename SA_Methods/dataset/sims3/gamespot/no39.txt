The content of the game brings nothing new and a lot less than The Sims 2. Everybody seams to forget the intrigue of this game. It's oblivious to me how the creators of this game did not come to understand that a underground garage cannot be built in the foundation of a sims house. After 30 hours of game play, including the building of my first house by hand, I could achieve all the acquisitions in the game. The "wish-system" is as predictable as a bad mannered poker player. The option of having a baby and all that comes with it is far behind what was in Sims 2.  Is this the way to start a so called "sequel"? How blunt can one get to leave so many things out just to have a expansion pack waiting to be should out in 3 to 6 months... Ups, did I say something bad? After playing Sims sience 2001 an waiting soooo much for the 3rd game excuse my revolt!
