The graphics are worse than the The Sims from 10+ years ago. This is no excuse...not even for a DS, my apologies. If you're going to spend money on this game, I highly recommend you buy the 3DS one instead, or save up for another one. The Sims in this game are not recognizable. I screamed at my DS because I saw some zombie thing, but it was actually my Sim.The controls are a whole mess...and my fingers were tangled up trying to control this game. When you move your furniture, it gets really frustrating.   And no way, I'm not comparing this to the PC game, but honestly...these graphics are so bad they deserve to be in a GBA. Why the hell is it for a DS game?   I have no complaints about music or the clothing selection. The opportunities are fun...but they give you such great rewards that the game becomes a little too easy... Remember that this game is rated E, so there absent from this game is the pleasure of torturing a sim and woohooing another.    Anyways, I really didn't enjoy this game. There are other positive reviews, but if you read the 3DS reviews, everyone is glad that the 3DS version does not look like this one.   Hope this review has helped!
