The Sims 3 was not expected to be amazing on consoles, but it could be a lot better. Basically The Sims 3 is the same as the other Sims games. You take care of your Sim, make them a house, get them a job, and buy them furniture and other things. I like the Sims games quite a lot, so don't think I dislike this game just because its a Sims game.   The graphics in The Sims 3 are actually good. They aren't really special but they look better than Goldeneye 007 on DS. The only problem is that there seems to be too many colors on the screen, it just hurts to look at the screen sometimes.   The gameplay in The Sims 3 is mediocre. There really is nothing special about the DS version that sets it apart from the other console versions. You would expect some sort of minigames but the minigames are absent from The Sims 3.  Other than the touch screen control the gameplay is the same in the DS version as the Wii, 360, or PS3 version.   The music in The Sims 3 is basically absent, you don't even notice it. The Sims series aren't known for their music, but some good background music would be nice.   Overall The Sims 3 on DS, is nothing special. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this game, instead get an extra $20 or $30 and buy the Wii, 360, or PS3 version.
