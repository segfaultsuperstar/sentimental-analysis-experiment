I love the Sims 3 on the PC, but on the Wii, you can tell it was just thrown together and released with a lot of bugs.   The bugs:   *You can set a plate down on the table, and it will fall through the table if you cancel his eating task while he is eating. Then it makes it impossible for him to pick up. So he is always mad about the place being dirty about that dish. The plate eventually appeared above the table onetime when I loaded the game again.  *The biggest bug of them all I think is that people die too much. They go to the beach and just drown. Or walk around and never eat. So there are graves everywhere, and the only way to get rid of them is to pick them up, take them to your house, and sell the grave. I had to do this about 35 times, which you can imagine got very annoying.  *Sometimes while learning skill, the bubble above his head won't appear, so I don't know if he is actually learning the skill or what.   The bads about the game:  *The thing I hated most about this game, and also made me give it a 4/10, was you can not turn off dying for your sim. You get 50 in game days, and you can imagine that is not long. Then on your 50th day, Death comes, kills you, then it pops up with "Your Sim had died. Press A to go back to the main menu." How stupid is that? I am just done, I have to start over again redoing everything if I want to play again.   The good:  *The only good thing I can honestly say about this game, is I love the way you go to work with your Sim and interact with what he does at work. You select different timed events he does while at work to help him improve his work and relation with workers and your boss.   Overall:  *The fact that your Sim dies without letting you keep playing or being able to turn off dying and all the bugs make this game not worth it. I wouldn't even recommend you rent this game. It is that bad. Just buy the game for PC, you will love it on PC.
