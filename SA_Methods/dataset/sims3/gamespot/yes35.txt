Bad. But lots of flaws and glitches. It takes about 2 real life days for your sims to die. So You can't achieve anything. Babies are a pain. They don't stop crying. Sims get moody too easily. They need 14 hours of sleep per day. When sims die the family are sad for a week. So they don't get promoted. If your sim dies your family is over. Its an enhanced version of sims 2. Sims Dying was a horrible idea. Old age should take weeks (Real)   Good: Create a sim is amazing. Hair and lots of download content. Lots of items. Cars are great to go downtown. Not like the original sims. Graphics are great and relationships don't fail so easily. Refusing a kiss doesn't result in hating each other. Its quite easy to play. Not laid back though. Your sims are always messing about,I'M HUNGRY,I'M LONELY,I'M TIRED. Its irritating. You can't leave the game for one second. Looking away can make your sims die. They mess with electrics often. Which will cause electricution. Make sure they don't meddle with stuff unless they are good at mechanical stuff.   Overall. Its not worth Â£30. Really just get it for christmas. Don't buy it yourself. You could buy Sims 2 for half the price. Its impressive with not as many flaws.
