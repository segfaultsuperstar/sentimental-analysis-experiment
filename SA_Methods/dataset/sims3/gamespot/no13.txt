Sims 3 is a great game, when it works ~ unfortunately that is not the case.  Since the game launched and several expansions later, the game still has critical issues that prevent people from playing the game, some people can play for longer bursts whilst others, are luckily to play for about 10 minutes before crashing to desktop.   The cause, sloppy coding especially with the save game function which has serious, repeat serious memory leak issues. This problem causes the entire save game to be corrupted and if the player is not careful to backup the game a serious amount of times, then weeks, months maybe even a years worth of work can be lost.   EA have constantly repeated these now famous words "We're sorry for the inconvenience and we'll look into this issue" but have yet to fix this major game breaking issue, yet still crank out expansions which compound the issue even more.  How about some solid fixes to serious problems first before cashing in on future expansions.   This problem of game breaking bugs is not a new issue, frankly its getting really out of hand, perhaps it is time for congress to step in and iron out some fair trading laws to deal with companies that produce games that are not fit to hit the stores, think about it ~ you wouldn't buy a brand new car knowing the engine under the hood is not complete, or is totally unreliable right? Yet many game companies do just this, and then blame a failing industry on piracy, how about releasing quality merchandise that works, repeat "works" then complain about lousy sales.
