Like the other expansions the sims 3: generations have some new interesting features and additions especially for teen sims, but i personally though that the features and additions should be in the sims 3 not in an expansion pack that released later on. As usual EA's habit always releases buggy expansions fot the sims 3. But unlike the other expansions generations have many bugs that made a game breaker, while the other expansions may have glitches and minor bugs, the generations pack has major bugs like missing, stuck, invisible sims and stuffs and many others.  It had been released for two weeks but EA hasn't release an update that fix these problems. Sure they can be released a patch next week or next month that MAYBE fix these problems but 'buggy at first release' habits in the sims 3 expansions are become truly annoying. If you are planning to buy this expansion pack, try to reading Technical discussions in its forum first.
