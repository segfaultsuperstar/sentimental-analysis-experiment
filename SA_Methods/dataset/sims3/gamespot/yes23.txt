Oh, the Sims. I have been playing this series of games for a very long time. It is one of my favorite video game franchises. I used to always play the Sims 2 on my computer, but then the Sims 3 came. My lousy computer couldn't handle it, so I stayed with the Sims 2.   Later I heard the Sims 3 was coming to consoles. I was excited about trying it so I went out and bought it.  It is a very fun game, but no where up to what the Sims 2 (PC) or the Sims 3 (PC) can do.    You should be able to walk around town without loading each lot, but sadly this is not the case. You still have to go to the menu, select the lot, and wait for it to load. In fact, most of the City is inaccessible, and to top it all off, you cant even build your own town. I found this part of the game very disappointing.   Bottom Line: I'll stick to the Sims 2.
