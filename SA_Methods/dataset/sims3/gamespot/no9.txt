Game has very very little background music.  Maybe 10-15 minutes tops.  Then the music will vanish never to be heard from again in your house.  Then you go to your neighbors house and all of the sudden it is playing.  So you know there can be music in the game, AND it is working just not where you want it to be working at.  But is there background music at all in this game?  I don't think there is.  Atleast I can't tell, and I believe you should be able to have your Stereo on and listen to it for along time.   In Sims 2 I can have the Stereo on and listen to it infinity.  It was so retarded to not include background music, just copy and paste from a game you built 5 years ago.  If this is any indication to the Legal system out there, that companies who build video games don't release finished products then I don't know what would convince them.   Background music is like tires on a car.  This doesn't have that in it.  So I can't rightfully give this game a score of anything more than a 1 until they add the tires.  BTW that's an Analogy, I really don't want tires with this game.  You know just incase the programmers where listening, because I have no idea how even a pre-schooler could mess up a copy and paste job.   Oh did I mention you need to pay $300 dollars to buy all the items at their online shop.  That is if you find the game is a skeleton crew (another analogy) of items and you want to add all the goodies to the game.  You see they decided to strip the game bare, put those items online, and make you purchase e-chairs and e-sofas to add to your game.  I paid $50 dollars to get a product that they stripped, then they told me if I want to get nice tires (more analogies) and chrome finish and even the paintjob and car stereo I'm going to have to fork over 6 times more than what the car cost in the first place.   Please...   Worst game standard in the industry, you can't set the bar lower than what they did with Sim 3...
