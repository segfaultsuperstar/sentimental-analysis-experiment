												Broke my toilet.Flirted with the repairwoman.Married her.She immediately aged to an elderly woman.10/10. Would get catfished again.In all seriousness, this game is addicting but really only worth it with a few of the DLC's, namely Seasons, Generations, Ambitions and possibly University Life (all of which contain features that should have been in the base game). For this reason, wait for a summer/Christmas sale because none of those are quite worth the $20 full price. Otherwise, it's a fun game if you like the previous Sims. Just... not worth $100 for a rich experience.
