												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FROM STEAM. As much as i friggin dislike origin i cannot recommend you buy this from steam at all.  1. This version from steam is 1.86 and origin has 1.87 which makes it function as intended. This is why so many steam users have issues with this game. the game launcher will constantly run in the background causing issues for your system and the game. On top of that because of this lack of the update from steam when you close the game the launcher still runs in the background meaning that while your not playing the game or have the sims actually open steam still records play time. You can close the game on your pc then go open steam and see it still running for yourself if you'd like. If you must have it and don't want do download origin like me then just be prepared for problems and if you do want a refund please please be aware of the launcher running in the background as it will record playtime if you close the game and the walk away leaving your computer on for 3 hours idling and downloading other games. I got denied my refund and had to spend atleast an hour or two researching and fixing this thing to work.
