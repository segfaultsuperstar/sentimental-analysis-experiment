												It's been said before, but it bears repeating: none of these expansion packs is worth 20 bucks, especially not the stuff packs. The game itself is very fun, but the cash-milking EA pulls with these things is just so despicable that I sadly must give The Sims 3 a big fat THUMBS DOWN. Sorry, Sims. I wish you had a better publisher. You deserve better.
