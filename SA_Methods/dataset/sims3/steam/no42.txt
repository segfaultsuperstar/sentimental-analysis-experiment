												I find it extremelly hard to recommend this game to anyone. I got it for my girlfriend; rather, I got an 1/8th of this game for my girlfriend. The full game, DLC and all, is roughly $420, microtransactions included. I can't imagine that production costs were so incredibly high that EA needed to charge me an entire paycheck to play a decent, addictive (but far from extraordinary) life simulator. I didn't know that I could hate EA anymore than I already did, but I do.The fact that there is a Sims 4 with a similar business model means that taking advantage of its customers seems to be a viable way for EA to make money. I urge everyone to spend as little on this game as possible. Hell, just torrent the game. It's single player, after all.
