												The Sims 3 is a decent game and a good follow on from The SIms 2. It's also better than The SIms 4.However it is only the base game and to get the really good content, you need to pay more for DLC.It all adds up so only buy if on offer. For this reason I would not recommend The Sums, I mean The Sims 3.
