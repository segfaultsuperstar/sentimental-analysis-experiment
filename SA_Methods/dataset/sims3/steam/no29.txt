												I love the Sims, but i can no longer recommend this game.  With everything installed, The Sims 3 is over 32 gigs. Tons of assets get loaded into memory, but the game can't handle it. EA has never updated this game to include a 64 bit executable, which means the game is restricted to 2GB of ram. Even after using a community patcher, the performance makes this game unplayable on a machine that should be well over the specs.I've tried the 64 bit community patcherDisabling the in-game storeTurn down the graphicsNothing helps.
