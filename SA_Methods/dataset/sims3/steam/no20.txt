												I've always really enjoyed the Sims games, but this DLC stuff is really out of hand. Its ridiculous to have to pay 20$ for each expansion pack. No one really wants to play without them, but getting them brings the price up to hundreds of dollars, which is ridiculous. And then they added microtransactions on top of it, which is completely absurd. I bought the bundle this time, hoping that the 3 expansion packs you get with it would be enough, only to realize that the three they bundle it with are only there because they're just basic aspects of the game that almost no one would play without! All they do is grant the ability to have full families with kids and pets, and changing seasons! Really?!? If this is how they're going to do things, I guess I'm done buying Sims games.
