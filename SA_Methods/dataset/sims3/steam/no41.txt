												If only EA wasn't one of the worst companies EVER....Sims 3 are the best sims IMHO, and I've tried each iteration of the series. Only things holding it back from a 10/10 are the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T DLC policy (with the cost of this game + all DLC, you could literally assemble a decent rig, it's 19 DLCs at 20 dollars each, plus another 20 for the base game... you do the math) and the performance. The game's engine is clearly pushed past it's limit and too often you get problems like glitches and "lag" because of this (I know it's not ACTUAL lag, since it's not an online game, but you know what I mean). It's infuriating to play this game almost 9 years after it's release and still struggle to make it run well. So, I'm downvoting the game because the whole DLC thing was pushed WAY TOO FAR here... I love The Sims 3, but the cost is simply unbelievable. It shows you how much EA cares about the playerbase. Only get this if it's on sale, as I did, and still... After carefully picking only the DLC I could get the most out of, it set me back some 40 dollars... for a 9 years old game that still doesn't run as it should.
