												I absolutely love this game and I've wasted way too many hours playing it, but why does the DLC have to be SO expensive? Especially when considering that the next generation of the game has already been released. I understand offering additional content for a little extra, but The Sims 3 takes this way too far. Either make the expansions cheaper or offer more in each one, because they aren't worth $20 as they are now.
