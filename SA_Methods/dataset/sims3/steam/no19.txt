												Im running windows 10 64 bit on a brand new computer with graphical capabilities that extend far beyond the limits of this game, yet after 10 minutes of playing, the game crashes and I am forced to manually close the game myself. I have spent hours online trying to find a solution to this problem but I have had no such luck. Total waste of money.
