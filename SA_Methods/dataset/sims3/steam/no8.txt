												I'm running it with few mods(one of which was suggested to fix the issues I was having) and the game freezes for roughly 45 seconds out of every minute. Its a great game but its full of advertizements you'd expect in a F2P game and its voodoo magic random chance if it will work on your computer regaurdless of how good it is. So far as I can tell its running at least 60 fps as the graphics are still silky smooth but the gameplay just hangs as the world freezes and strangely enough trees and the gem above my sims head are still animated.The game is also VERY pushy about getting you to log into EA's servers and post facebook like stuff which equally gets in the way wether you're playing to trap sims inside of a swimming pool or play normally. I know not everybody has this problem but so far as I can tell its been around since at least 2009, possibly since the release of the game itself, I don't know, I don't care apparently a core i7 processor and 16 gb of ram aren't good enough for this game and I can only judge it by my personal expieriences with it.Granted though its a good game if you can get it running, however its so monetized with addons of all kinds some of which are of dubious value especially compared to the wealth of modding content you can get for free.
