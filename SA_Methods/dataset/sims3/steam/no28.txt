												I love the Sims 3, I find it extremely fun and addictive. Now you're probably wondering why the big red thumbs down? Well... First of all, the game costs $400 for all the DLC and there are Micro-transactions! Micro-transactions should not be in games I pay for or in single player games! This is a complete waste of money, where I could buy about 30 games with $400 rather than getting a bunch of DLC that are a complete waste of money. I don't mind buying/paying for DLC, but when I have to pay for extra content to get the full experience, and it will cost me $400 when I have already bought the game and if I want to have couches, fridges, clothes, expansion packs, etc, it will cost real money, this just makes me question how stupid does EA think we are? I would recommend buying the game, but the DLC will make the game actually a lot better, so its recommended to buy the game on sale and pick it up for about $100. I sure as hell thought the game was fun and had a lot of things to do, but paying huge amounts of money into a game is way too much for me and I'm pretty sure for anyone else.
