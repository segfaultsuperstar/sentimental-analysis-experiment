												I couldn't find anyone to marry so I stalked a teenage girl until she was an adult then forced her to break up with her boyfriend, Invited her to my house, cooked her Spaghetti and got married in the kitchen. Now all she does is burn down the house with her foul cooking everyday. If I wasn't a special agent this would be a bigger problem as it's already a pain buying new ovens all the time. I keep thinking of ways I can kill her to free me and my daughter from the fiery death that she will curse upon us all...I'll show her....I'll show them all...Also Sims 3 is alright.9.222222222222222222222222222222222222322223...../10
