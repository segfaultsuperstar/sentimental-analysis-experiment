												Bought the game with the University DLC, and the DLC doesn't work (the DLC was why I made the purchase). Tried various ways to resolve the issue following advice from forums, and nothing works. Because of this I have exceeded the time played according to the Steam refund policy. Not happy.I have played this game before when it first came out and was really looking forward to playing it again. This was a massive let down.
