												I have a couple hundred hours on disk version, back when this game was first releasedI can't believe what a microtransaction wasteland this game has become, I spend Â£6 on this game to be told "LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF YOU DON'T HAVE" and have it dangled in front of me whenever I'm creating a family, buying items for my home and building stuff.I do think the price is a pretty good deal for the amount of time you'll get out of it, but the base game is genuinely just showing you all this stuff you should buy, and it honestly gets extremely annoying. It's not really what I remember when I first started playing it, sure, it's the same game, but it's so full of "LOOK AT THIS ITEM FOR 200 CREDITS"Also if you want all the expansions you'll have to part with a LOT of money, Sims is definitely one of my favourite franchises of all time, but the old ones didn't throw DLC in your face, sure, there was a metric f*ckton of expansions that you CAN buy, but it wasn't plastered all over the game. Honestly, the game is great, the DLC isn't.
