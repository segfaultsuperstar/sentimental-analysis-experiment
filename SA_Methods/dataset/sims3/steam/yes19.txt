												I loved this game because there is so much to do and it is quite a lot like real life. I also saw how all the sims got better and better. The expantion packs may be a bit expensive and I think they should be cheaper but the sims 3 is one of the best games i've got. I disliked how expensive the expantions were but they are add ons. I liked every thing about the actuall game just because EA must of taken a lot of time and effort to get the sims to this level. Thanks for reading and hopefully you will buy a very very good game. :)
