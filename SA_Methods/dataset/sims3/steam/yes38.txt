												The Sims 3 is a game with simulation, and if you want simulation this is the right game. The sims is a game were you can relive your life how you wanted to live your life, and if your life is perfect this isn't the game for you. Their are also Expansion packs. If you don't know what an Expansion pack is it's basicly more things to add to your game, for instance Theirs pets, surernatural, island paridiso, High end loft stuff, And more. So I hope you consider downloading the sims 3!
