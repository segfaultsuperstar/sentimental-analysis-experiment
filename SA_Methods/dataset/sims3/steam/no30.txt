												I love the Sims, the problem with it is that the DLCs start to get expensive. So expensive in fact I haven't played the Sims in forever, since the base game feels horrifically bland in comparison. :( Sims, why not make the weather/pets/university pack a part of your core game, since that's pretty much a part of LIFE?Since reading is hard for some of you:I do not recommend this game because it is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ base game, the previous versions of the Sims were much better, the DLCs are way too expensive, and there wasn't anything significant innovative.
