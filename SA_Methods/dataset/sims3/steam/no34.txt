												The price for the game and the dlc's are a greedy bad joke. It's a 10 year old game yet they are still asking full tripple A prices for the expansion dlc's.  I already own the retail version of the game, but the dlc's are not compatible so I had to buy the main game twice to be able to download and use the dlc's from Steam as well. I have followed the sales on Steam hoping to grab them at a nice big discount, but I haven't seen them drop below 50% still during the sales. The game has a launcher that keeps promoting junk and ingame you constantly get facebook messages (do you want to share this moment?) which is abusolutely ridiculous. The game is also filled with micro transactions and you are constantly reminded that you can buy more stuff.... while already having payed a lot of money for this old game. The game iself is still a fun game and it aged alright, but for today's standard the gameplay is quite limited and shallow and definitely not worth the tripple A price anymore.
