												The best game in the Sims franchise. It has an organized and intuitive play system, well bodied and fun expansions, and not to mention the widest variety of occult sims and towns/locations. The downsides are long screen wait times, repetitive music, and poor use of "create a sim" (CAS) customization sliders. Overall it is a great game and worth the buy.
