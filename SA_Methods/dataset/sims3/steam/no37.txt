												A bit odd how adding a dog to a world costs around the same as the base game. It's 2017, this game is 8 years old and it still costs $20 to get a dog. But am I surprised? No ea is still the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ money hungry company as it's always been. Rather than bring a near dead gae back to life and up overall purchases how about we treat the costomers like trash. My view of the game is severely damaged by A DOG IN AN 8 YEAR OLD GAME BEING $20. Put the prices from $20 to 5 on the major DLC and even less on minor DLC and this review could change.
