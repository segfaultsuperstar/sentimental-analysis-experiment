You'd think picking up a renegade bounty hunter in a space soap opera would lead to some brilliant tension in your party or some dramatic showdowns between crew members or fantastically slimy adventures among criminal elements, or at the very least some clever sarcastic commentary as you play through the base game ... but no, not really. With The Price of Revenge, you get some decent voice acting with some kind of Australian accent, along with an altogether middling loyalty mission that takes you inside a generic warehouse to shoot some generic Blue Sun baddies and ... well, that's about it really.   If you're a ME2 completionist, it's obviously worth picking up or downloading. But if you're looking for a worthwhile new crew member, you're far better off with Kasumi's Stolen Memory. While Kasumi isn't necessarily more interesting, personality-wise, she's way more useful in combat with an excellent unique ability (maybe the best in the game) and a fantastic, super-accurate new SMG to play around with.   On the upside, you do get a new flamethrower heavy weapon and Zaeed is a competant combatant (assault rifle/sniper specialty), especially early in the game when your party options are otherwise limited to Jacob and Miranda.
