Really theres not much to say about this latest downloadable content, mostly because there wasn't much content. This is no Shadow Broker.   The levels you move through are tiny. There's little setup. Things feel rushed. They introduce one character and then discard her. There's no moral struggle. The action is always fun but it wasn't challenging.   As much as it's nice to again visit the Mass Effect 2 universe I kind of feel they should simply save all these tiny content blocks and release them all together in a regular expansion. Collectively all the added content would make a good sized addition but when they release one at a time it just leaves the player unfulfilled.   Perhaps I've just spent too much time playing this game but the seams are really starting to show for me. There was one very obvious moment where it was clear that Bioware decided to save some cash this time and not pay for one of their regular voice actors. It may be smart business but it just came off looking cheap, almost like they weren't interested in putting out their best effort.
