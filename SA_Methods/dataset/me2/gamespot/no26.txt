So many holes, lazy plot decisions, and an ending that could have been the best in the entire series.. but wasn't. If you love the series, you have to buy it.. but you'll be left irritated by how "taped" together everything feels.      SPOILER: For those who have played it.. you can read these and know I share your frustration.   - Reapers have the Commander sedated.. kill him maybe? Nah.. we'll just knock him out with cheap sedatives.. oh he's waking up? How convenient, and just in time to spoil our plans.   - This scientist chick, boring.    - If your character is not built with some sort of crowd control, good luck getting the achievements on insanity.   - If I were a Reaper, and I was transmitting my image to threaten someone.. I'd make sure I was 40 stories tall with a voice that crumbles foundations. Instead? Harbinger shows up 3 stories tall, says nothing important, and then leaves.    - There's a weapon crate before you enter the base.. just write it on the door the Commander is going to have to shoot.. there were no surprises - at all.
