Title says it all pretty much,   The one part that annoyed me the most was the main character. SO ANNOYING!   The story falls flat and i beat it in about 45minutes. For 560MPP its definitely a ripoff. You get three prototype upgrades...Big deal by now im sure the majority of players have beaten the game and previous DLC's.   The enemies do hit hard though and provide a good challenge very hard. A cool new concept of playing with just Sheppard really makes you appreciate your squadmates when there not around.   The two areas you visit aren't anything special. Nothing compared to Shadow Broker by any means. Also a new weapon addition or something worth coming back ot might of made the value a little better.   All in all its disappointing. If this was on sale for 200MPP I'd buy it. Full price? forget about it.
