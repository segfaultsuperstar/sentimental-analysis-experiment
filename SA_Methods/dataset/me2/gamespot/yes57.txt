Great game play, great graphics, superior level design.  Very, very fun to play, apart from "scanning planets".  It is a very good game, if you consider it to be just a game.   Ok, so, Shepard resurrects and he's cool about it. It's all ok. All in a days work, I think. He doesn't seem to be happy, sad, frightened, confused, et al with it, let alone does he seem to feel he has heightened sense of responsibility for being given a second chance.   Some introspection would be nice, but no dice.  Long gone are the days where Shepard would be beaten by circumstances, laying in the floor of his ship, only to be lifted back to the fight by his love interest. You know, what humans usually do.  Bioware thought it would be better to make the greatest human hero of the galaxy everything but... human.   And let's not forget that a great villain makes a great hero. Where is the great villain in this one? I never thought i would put these words together: "I wish Saren was alive."   I absolutely loved F.E.A.R., for example, because it delivered what was expected of it.   Can't say the same for ME2, however, because I hoped for more of the ME1 poignancy, which has been discarded in favor of eye candy - which CAN coexist with human drama.   Hear me, Bioware: Blade Runner is much about the setting, but it is mostly about what happens in it. Don't forget that in your third entry, make more than just a game.
