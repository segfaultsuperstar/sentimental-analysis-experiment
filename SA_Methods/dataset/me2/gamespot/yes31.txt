Spoilers   I was so looking forward to playing this game having waited, what near enough 3 years. I couldn't wait to continue on Shepards quest to stop the reapers.  Having watched all the trailers on xbox live and websites i was looking forward to some reaper killing. Especially after the cinematic trailer where Shepard, Grunt, and Thane are fighting collectors, then walk up a ramp and lo and behold there's a reaper. Woo. was so excited.  Needless to say how dissapointed i was to find out how little actual story there was. There were only 4. yes 4 missions that actually progressed the story.1 go to horizon. 2 investigate collector ship. 3 aquire reaper IFF. 4 Defeat the collectors. Thats it.  Now while i don't mind, infact i really enjoyed "assembling a team" it seems that that was all i was doing. Gaining their loyalty was good for the added skills it gave you and the extra hours of play, however i can't get past the lack of any reapers.   Well accept for the dead one and the god awful giant terminator "reaper" last boss.  It just seems to me that this game was to short in the main story department.  Also various little things bugged me like how few weapons there were in the game ME1 had plenty of variety there. Also the new need to reload. WTF.  All in all it was quite a good game. graphially very impressive, but i can't forgive the lack of main story missions.   and my fish kept on dying but the space hampster didn't.
