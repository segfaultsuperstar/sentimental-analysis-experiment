WARNING! Some spoilers of this dlc is included.   Whos idea was it to make a dlc where Shepard blows up an entire solar system with loads off innocent casualties? Thats nothing i want my Shepard to do, experience or live with. To begin with, this dlc is stupid. You save an agent that have found evidence that a reaper invasion is going to happen. You go to her huge asteroid base no one knows about led by no organization where the saved agent plans to blow up a mass relay to prevent the reapers to come throw. There are mass relays everywhere in the galaxy so why they should show up in that specific mass relay is just stupid. By the looks of the massive base they must have had years to prepare their attack on the relay but  then you find out that they dont want to blow it up and it makes everything just more stupid. Why build the damn thing if they want to prevent the destruction of the mass relay? I dont know, so Shepard gets the job to blow up the mass relay and the whole solar system, kills many innocent people and Shepard gets the blame. Thats it, its like a mission failed but except it isnt. You dont even know if the invasion was true or not. A waste of time and effort.
