It's easy to criticize Arrival, considering the high quality of its two outstanding DLC predecessors. Even if Arrival's scope doesn't exactly equal what was on display in Overlord and Shadow Broker, there's still a lot to enjoy in this brief solo mission that sets up an interesting potential opening to Mass Effect 3.   In just 90 minutes, Bioware tells an engaging search-and-rescue story and develops a new character to the point where you'll have some kind of emotional reaction to the events that unfold. Unfortunately, the major decisions you make in Arrival seem to be decided in advance for you. You can approach each key situation from a paragon or renegade perspective, but it has no tangible effect on how events play out or how the world of ME3 will be affected. That said, this is still an entertaining mini-drama to play through that, for me at least, got my blood pumping in a few places.   The weakest part of Arrival, which the rest of ME2 and its DLC usually knocked out of the park, is the level design and combat sequences. You'll storm through a lot of vanilla recycled corridors and space station hallways in what should otherwise have felt like an epic battle across a gigantic asteroid. Instead, you get brief glimpses outside and no real sensation that you're ever really heading toward an ominous target. The final stage at least gives you a unique environment, but it's too little, too late, as the mission wraps up shortly after. Combat sequences are fairly straight-forward and well-balanced for solo play.   All in all, Arrival is a satisfying sendoff for one of the best games of recent years, even if it falls short of the games that preceded it.
