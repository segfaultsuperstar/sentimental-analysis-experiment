Mass Effect 2 does an excellent job of extending the story from its predecessor.  However, the game play is so bogged down by numerous cut scenes and dialogue that it slows down the action and eventually gets annoying.  The action is also somewhat linear with you just walking down the only available corridors or paths, leaving little room for any substantial strategy.  Also the storyline involves a lot of team building and history that comes to feel highly repetitive.  Also, the skill building and weapon improvement scheme seems dumbed down from the original giving you fewer choices for tweaking your equipment outside of just buying better items.  The game overall looks great and well polished, but the load times for the game are long.  At times it made me think to myself "Do I really want to go the engineering bay on the ship? It will take a while."
