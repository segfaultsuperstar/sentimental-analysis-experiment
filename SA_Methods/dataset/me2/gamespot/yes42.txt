Spoilers*   This is a short, uninspired DLC. Shepard goes in alone for this one, you won't have a squad. The first part is painfully boring as you search through tight corridors and solve easy puzzles, with the occasional enemy, to finally reach your target, an alliance doctor you've been sent to rescue. She explains to you that a reaper invasion is imminent and takes you to her research station to learn more about a project she has been working on to slow it down. Once you get there it takes a predictable turn and you spend the rest of the DLC fighting through the complex.   I won't go into detail here, but the premise is fairly interesting. There may be an Oh snap! Moment and a bit of confusion depending on how familiar you are with ME:1. Theres a segment where you play as a security mech, but it's not very special or unique.   The bottom line? $7 is a lot for an hours worth of gameplay. The DLC isn't terrible, but isn't what we've come to expect from Bioware. Don't hope for another lair of the shadowbroker. I absolutely love mass effect and do not regret my purchase, though I'm sure many will.
