Overlord provides a welcome return of a centerpiece of Mass Effect action - charging into a Cerberus research facility and shooting everything that moves.  It provides more of the solid action and well-realised locations that we've come to expect from Mass Effect 2.  It also provides a striking and memorable finale.   The whole thing is seriously marred, though, by overuse of that Hammerhead flying tank thing from the Firewalker mission, still lacking so much as a compass and now requiring you to play Frogger on a lava flow.  Since the vehicle both handles and sounds like a soup can in a washing machine, these vehicle platforming moments come across as trite and annoying - the very opposite of the superbly handled skycar sequence in Shadow Broker.   Without the Hammerhead segments, this would have rated a solid 8.  Those sections were so un-fun that they detracted seriously not only from my enjoyment of the DLC but from the entire game.  Once you get past that nasty Hammerhead rind there is some tasty action within, but on the whole I'd only recommend this one for the completists.
