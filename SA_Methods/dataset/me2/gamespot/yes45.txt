First complaint, the subtitles are the same color as most of the background colors.   Second, the plot or lack thereof.  Yeah, collectors new baddies who come out of nowhere and one shot the Normandy for some reason have decided to make a human reaper... why ?  Never explained.  Aren't there like hundreds of reapers already incoming ?  Yeah... so why would they wanna make a human one ?  Who knows, because its never explained.   Gameplay -  Same as the first with a few minor complaints.  My guy and all his team look the same thru the entire game.  I really hate that.  I was new gear with unique graphics and more then two guns to use for my particular class.   As for the team I recruit I hate them all.  They're all dbags who push their problems on you to solve to actually make them loyal lolz.  Ok I just meet someone and after they hide away on the ship I command they come to me with some kind of personal issue that I have to solve or they don't like me.  Hello, let me introduce you to the air lock /spaces them.
