how  this game got  a decent score ill never know, played it for well over 20 hours i never quite knew if i was on the correct path or had missed any crucial infomation, in thoses 20 hrs i did little fighting but what i did do a lot of was running about looking for people to advance the plot and boy can thoses characters talk and talk, i  think i was chatting and running about looking for keycards for well over 80% of the time, i ended up just skipping through what they were saying to get rid of them, hence missing crucial plot details, it drove me bloody crazy, i used to enjoy theses games but now i have a girlfriend and a job,  so if you also have these i wouldnt recommend it at all, or this summer you will be lonely and you will have no tan.  one decent thing about the game was the graphics they were above average.
