I'm not a reviewer , so don't expect this to be long.     The audio lag in this game is seriously bad. It really takes you out of the game. Also, sometimes Conversations just cut off before they finish. Thank god I always put subtitles on but seriously.   what is this ****   The game is good and it's fun to play. But the serious audio issues is what drags down what would of been a 9.0 to a 6.5   I've heard that the PC version doesn't have this issue.  But many PS3 owners encounter this.   It's a shame.  Maybe Bioware will stop rushing out games and actually take the time to iron out little things like this.   As for game play. It's just like the first game, a little different but not a big learning curve.   Anyways, Thanks for reading this. whether you agree with me or not. I'm glad you took the time to read it.
