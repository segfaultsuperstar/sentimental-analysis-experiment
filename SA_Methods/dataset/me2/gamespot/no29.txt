My quote on the intro pretty much sums it up.  They took everything i enjoyed from the first game as far as traveling around to different planets, searching through cities for weapons and armor, that i can hardly say it's even a sequel.  It's the most dumbed-down version of a new game i have ever seen, and that is a pretty tall order over MW2.  In the first game, i felt the combat was almost a buffer between getting to the next storyline/discovering situation, while in this game it is the focus and it's just  fun at all.  There have to be others sitting there with the same questions as me, like where did all the rpg elements go perhaps?     The mini-game nonsense like the probing worlds is outrageous, i mean really who finds that enjoyable.  Why would you take all the weapons out of the game, if i were a designer my first idea would say hey! lets add new weapons and armor to customize their characters.  This game feels rushed from the first hour in to the last.  I'm sorry but i will not be picking up number 3 when that ships next fall (i assume) to complete a decent story without gameplay behind it.  If you like average action games, have at it, but i expected a lot more from this and they failed miserably.    OUT.
