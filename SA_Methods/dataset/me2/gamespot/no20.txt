(Sorry for my English - not my first language)   First DA II - De gustibus non est disputandum, but in my opinion it's just a weak Hack and Slash... and now "Arrival" - short, buggy, storyless, disco shooter. This year begun like a worst nightmare for us RPG fans out here.   First come the highlights:  +still good shooter - they didn't broke that. Tried - there's not much here than a shooting (quite mindless if I have to be honest), but it's still good pulling the trigger  +2 minutes of story worthy to watch   And the shadows. I don't even know where to start. But let's make short summary - yeah, the word is "short".  -it's a short one :P  -suposed to be a bridge between ME2 and ME3, but it's everything we know, just in more boring way  -Bioware didn't think it's nessesery to record more than few new lines of dialogues for the fully voiced baby O_o'. Rest is handled by immortal text lines - boooooring!  -There's nothing to do - every decision worthy to make is what You'll have to see. No choice for You, not this time. The creators know better what's good for You (smells like DAII spirit)  -this instaltment is supoused to show players how things happened - to build the bridge between ME2 and ME3. But hey? What about forget about that, and do some shooting... and story? Just don't think about it. Things happen all the time (the last reason to make this DLC failed for me at this point) - jsut like sh!t  -The levels are small and short (agian - it seems that DAII show us new way to entertain audience :/)  -lot of bugs (no betatesting?)  -I've just payed 7$ to break my humor :/   At the end - a must have for collector (put 1 more point if You are - there is nothing like more content for Your favourite game, even if it's just an hour of gaming) and a big "AVOID" sign for all the rest. I've just become "the rest". No more Bioware stuff for me - that's just as much crap & "grab-the-cash-while-you-still-can-attitude" I can handle :(
