Everything about this game is an exclamation point on the 18-35 male demographic's rampage through cinema and sadly,gaming. The plot largely relies on Fred Saberhagen's Berserker series.   Control scheme has one key used for 3 different actions as if the PC is limited to the 10 or so buttons on a spaz pad. Very clunky at best. Not so much an rpg as an action game(can't really call it a shooter either).   Choices are so limited early that I wanted to shoot my companions. Instead one has to listen to them call you Shepard or Shep(the character who's role you assume). You get a first name so I dubbed him "Imnot".   If you played Knights of the old rebellion you will recognize many of the textures and sets being reused here. The mechs look like escapees from the clone wars and the list of borrowed/stolen ideas etc goes on and on.   So don't believe the hype unless maybe you fall into the above mentioned demographic. Wait for a bargain bin...I know a couple people who would look at it for 5 bucks. I would need to be paid more than that just to unwrap the damn thing...
