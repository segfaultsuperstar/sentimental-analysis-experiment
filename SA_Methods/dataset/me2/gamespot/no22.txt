This is purely decorative DLC ... a great idea to memorialize the crash site of the fallen Normandy and collect dog tags of dead crew members to send to their families. There's a nice tip of the hat to your navigator as well, but the scope of this mission is extremely thin. Bioware blew an opportunity to build some interesting story-driven content around this concept, instead of just having you wander around a field fetching items for 15 minutes. Return to Ostagar from Dragon Age is very similar in scope, except they built out an actual storyline, gave you motivation to play through and seek some revenge with combat that actually gave some gameplay and value to the DLC.   Emotionally, yes, this is a nice acknowledgement to play through and reminisce. But it really could have been a lot more.
