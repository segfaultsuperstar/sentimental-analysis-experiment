Out of the 3 free DLCs for Mass Effect 2, this might seem like the best one but unfortunately it isn't. The Price of Revenge adds a new recruitable companion and his loyalty mission. Unlike all other squad members of Mass Effect 2, the mercenary veteran Zaeed (the new team mate) has a loyalty mission which is unlocked right after recruiting him. Zaeed is good in combat and even though he is an interesting character and his story is quite unique, his personality isn't original, being the usual cyberpunk, badass, bounty hunter he is. Zaeed's loyalty mission is fun and of course, like all the other loyalty missions, it has an important choice you have to make at the end. Even though it doesn't last that long and does feel inferior to the loyalty missions of the other squad members, it still gives you at least 1 hour of new gameplay.Another bad thing about Zaeed Massani, is his dialogue.. there barely is any at all. There are no conversations with him in the game apart from the really short conversation when recruiting him on Omega and some dialogue in his loyalty mission. You cannot talk to him on the Normandy at all which really strips this DLC of depth and detail and all you can do is select him and wait to hear the same one of the 5 speeches you've heard from him before. Of course, like any other of your team mates, he will make a few comments about the environments you visit or when teamed up with a specific character.So, now you ask if this is really worth buying? Well it is worth buying, it's free to download from Bioware so you don't even buy it! But is it worth using in Mass Effect 2? Well, you do get a new squad member who lasts forever... unlike his short loyalty mission.OVERALL RATING – 6.5/10 (Passable)NEW GS RATING – 6/10
