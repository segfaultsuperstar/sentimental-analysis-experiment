Downloaded this the other day from the Cerebus Network, the game add-on adds 5 new assignments to your Journal. Be warned these assignments are painstakingly easy. You spend most of your time driving your new hover vehicle. The hover vehicle is a step up from the Mako from Mass Effect 1 as far as maneuverability goes, but if you are thinking this DLC adds openness to the game like vast exploration the planets on Mass Effect 1 had guess again. You pretty much have to travel through linear paths on each Firewalker planet in search for missing researchers data, and you will mostly be using your hovers scanner to collect that data.  Sometimes you will have to get out of the hover and explore a small facility to complete the objective.              The only combat you have in this DLC is from the hover, and that's only on a couple of the 5 different planets this DLC add, they are mostly Geth rebots which can easily be defeated using the hovers powerful turret, that has no charge or hit limitation to it, just spam it against the enemies and voila. It seems that one of the 5 Firewalker planets will unlock an achievement and that's it. Nothing else added to the game.  No new conversations given to your crew.  You don't even really get to look at your crew when you're on the Firewalker planets because the atmosphere condition require everyone be fully concealed.             The only saving grace of this DLC is that it is Free.   Mass Effect 1's DLC Bringing Down the Sky and Pinnacle Station were far better than this.
