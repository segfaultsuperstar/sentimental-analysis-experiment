The Good: Kasumi is a great character, good firefights towards the end   The Bad: Way too short, doesn't change the game at all in any way, feels pointless after it's all over   Mass Effect 2 has a slew of great DLC, but Kasumi's Stolen Memory is probably the shortest of them all. The DLC has two short parts to it. The first is you trying to find Kasumi which doesn't really make you do much, and the second is sneaking into Hock's safe to find Kasumi's stolen graybox, but it all seems pointless in the end.   There's a good boss fight at the end, and it gets pretty intense plus you can pick up a new weapon as well as some other things like credits, salvaged parts etc. It's your typical standard ME2 affair, and there are no game play changes of course. Kasumi is a great character, and her stealth abilities really shine in combat and she can get you out of trouble in a pinch. She's a very mysterious character and has a lot of sarcasm to her so she's great to listen to and has an interesting past.   I would have liked to see more than just a little infiltration mission since there's so much potential with her, and hopefully we'll see her in Mass Effect 3. The whole DLC can be beaten in just one sitting so you might feel like your $4 was wasted, so this isn't the ME2 DLC available. It's great for hardcore ME fans, but casual players of the game should this one up.
