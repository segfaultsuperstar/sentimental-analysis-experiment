There really isn't much to say about the next round of too-expensive DLC for Mass Effect 2.   SPOILER   Basically it's five levels and a "boss" that tell a not particularly interesting story and don't amount to a whole lot. Had the DLC been free, I would have thought it a decent way to spend an hour. For another $8 (or whatever depending on how many points you need) it was another disappointing turn for a classic game.   Frankly. Kasumi and Overlord feel very much like bits left out of the original game and packaged up as a cash grab.    Essentially yet another Cerberus scientist is doing bad stuff and you need to troll through some levels to kill everything. The puzzles are neither clever nor fun (i.e. the elevator), the story is middling...   Basically, as with Kasumi...if you want to spend the cash to get another level...fine...but, for me, the two $ DLC's have added nothing to my ME2 experience.
