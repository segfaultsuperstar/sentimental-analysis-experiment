Mass Effect is my crack. I read all the books and comics, and I 100% completed the Achievements on both games, with all addons (even have the iphone game).   I won't spoil the plot. However, this is short. Really short. Like 35 min. short.   Chances are, having played this expansion will greatly affect your import into Mass Effect 3. If you don't care about this, though, i honestly suggest just reading the plot online.   The other main add ons gave you something for completing them. Something you could use in the main game. A character or cool weapon, for instance.  This, or they added a fresh gameplay feature.   You get nothing for completing this, other than a quasi-satisfying ending.   Bioware seems to understand that this was a weak link, because it's for sale a lot cheaper than the other addons.   There were a few graphical glitches, and more than one enemy got stuck in a wall, but they'll likely fix this.   No matter how you put it, you obviously have to get this if you're a Mass Effect enthusiast like myself.   If not, this is worth waiting on, at least until it's on sale.  --Dane
