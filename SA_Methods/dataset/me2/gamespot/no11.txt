Not sure why this game gets such high reviews?  As a claimed RPG I think it fails in almost every aspect a n RPG had going for it.  Its basically a third person shooter with a good storyline.  If it was labled as a shooter I would have rated the game a 8-9, but hailed as an RPG, just crap.  Basically all the RPG elements are removed from the game, charater building can be done by a third grader, and now you have to find updgrades for your guns isntead of getting new weapons or armor? you cant buy many of them or can u ind new guns very often?? And they remove one headache from the firs game (the MAKO) and add in one that is worse (mining for minerals)?   Also this game takes place a few years after the first, but for some unknown reason, the technology devolves, In the first game you basically have limitless ammo, and know you are forced to find ammo clips?? What is with that?    Also have to love the basic absence of any boss fight whatsover.    Enough negative, some positive, the graphics are better, gameplay smoother (although numerous times your characters can fly through the air and be standing on nothing) .  If you like dialogue in a game this has plenty for you thats for sure.   All in all this game had the feel of a HALO game that was tried to be made into an RPG by just adding levels.  Did the developers want to make a space game but not compete in the first person shooter world? No idea, but I do know that im dissapointed in this game to say the least.
