Keeping in mind that this is a DLC I knew beforehand that it would just be a short adrenaline shot. However I did not expect it to be that short. Within an hour you can finish this expansion (if you manage to beat all the battles on your first run while gunning for battle achievements).  I will not be discussing graphics etc the same that applies for the original game.   Storyline:  The storyline is not very solid although I expect it to solidify in Mass Effect 3, but really doesn't provide many clues on how exactly things happened... you just guess what has happened. Therefore you do not get the satisfaction that you have actually discovered something.   Battles:  There are a couple of battles that are exciting and even if playing in normal difficulty they are challenging. But that ends here.   Aftermath:  If it was a standalone game I would rubbish it without pause. Even as a DLC it left me disappointed, I expected more, like Overlord. So you might be wondering why bother buying it and why did I ever gave it a 6?   Reasoning:  Mass Effect 1 & 2 are such great games that fans drool over the prospect of playing even a little bit more of the game. Hell yeah it is an amazing series and if you are one the hardcore fans who would not miss out on Mass Effect 3 I believe by playing this DLC you will get a head start and anticipate ME3 even more. I consider it as a prologue to ME3. So save your saves and be ready to export your character later this year :)
