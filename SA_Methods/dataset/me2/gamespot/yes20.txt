Mass Effect 2: Firewalker lets you drive a new vehicle and will take you through five missions full of fun, action and entertainment. Even though the missions let you see some breath-taking environments, they are over way too fast and the whole DLC hasn't got nearly enough content for anyone's liking. Also, the first mission, compared to the other four is a bit disappointing but that is understandable because it also serves as a tutorial which teaches you how to use the vehicle. The Hammerhead (the vehicle) itself is quite fun to drive and while at first, you may find the controls a bit clunky, you will get used to them pretty quickly after about 15 minutes of gameplay.   Completing all five of the Firewalker missions takes approximately from 1 to 2 hours. In this DLC, none of the combat takes places on-foot but you will get to walk around a bit during the missions, even if only for a few minutes. You must be wondering if the Firewalker mission pack is worth downloading. Well, considering the fact that this is free to download from Bioware's website, of course it is worth downloading but not as worthy of playing. If you want to have a look at a few cool sights and play around with the Hammerhead, you should play it but if you are not interested in DLC packs containing barely any content and you don't like short missions, then you should pass on this one because you might consider it a waste of time.
