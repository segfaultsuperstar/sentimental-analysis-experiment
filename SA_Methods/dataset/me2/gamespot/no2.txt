I just ordered the game, and honestly I can't play it without the subtitles. It seems like the company hated people to read subtitles and designed really tiny fonts. While designers and producers can make anything they want, is the duty of the gaming community to bring up the problems and to prevent the companies from selling crap.    So, I am really disappointed that the GAMESPOT review does not mention the font issue, at least in the "cons" list: can't be played on SDTVs. You could have saved some people some money. I wonder how much Bioware pays the popular game reviewers.   The second problem that I had is how to save the game. I played the first level and then died and there was no save available. Does the game have the save disabled ?   The small font problem appears in other games too, I checked a demo of the latest splinter cell and the fonts were unreadable.
