I played through the first Mass a couple of times with different character builds.  I purchased Mass Effect 2 with hopes of a continued story and an improvement on the third person rpg shooter that the first was.  Man was I disappointed,  I found that bioware decided that they would trash the rpg elements and make this a glorified over the shoulder shooter.  Now if you like being the warrior/tank/soldier then that would have been killer right! Well as I prefer to play as those classes I usually tinker with the more obscure casting classes and try and challenge myself.  Mass 2 eliminated the need to even use anything other than your rifle.  Plus the build options have gone from many to non.  Not to mention the story is very repetitive,  walk into a room see a bunch of cover spots, get into a fire fight, then repeat 100X.  The visuals in this game are amazing but that is all I would give a 9 or 10 for.  Good job Bioware on taking a great opportunity at a sequel and blowing it.
