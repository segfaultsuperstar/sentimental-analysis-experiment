Im new to the xbox360 but i´ve played games for nearly four decades on various consoles and PC´s.  To see this game get so highly praised by many just leaves me with the feeling that then the overall quality on games for the X-box must be quite low, just guessing here.  The RPG genre is  a favorite of mine and i was expecting more meat on the bone with Mass Effect2.   Overall the dialogue in the game can become very hightech, long, boring and irrelavant to the gameplay. And the gameplay itself, the core of it, the actual part you P L A Y. Not just going around looking to find the next person to talk to is.. as first mentioned, only OK.  Flawed and disturbed by wheels you have to pull up for changing weapons and using powers but what really is the main complaint is that they´ve used the same button for activating, taking cover and sprint in the game. So needless to say, you can do the first when you really wanted to do the later in combat.  This comes from someone used to PC´s keyboard and mouse for control and aiming, and i admit im no big fan of relying on the right xbox controller knob for aiming.   I don´t know, usually i agree with the overall opinion for any game or place somewhere close to it  but not for this game.   Maybe im just spoiled with good games and expected too much.
