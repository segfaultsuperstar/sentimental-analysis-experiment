It's still the Mass Effect Universe, You can shoot up and or use your Biotic or Tech powers to decimate the enemy.  However, since it's just you and the one person you rescue, you can't make use of the Team you've built up in the game.  There seems to be less voice acting and banter than the main game and great previous DLC like Lair of the Shadow Broker.  The Enemy AI seems to be less refined, sometimes not even noticing you until you open up on them at close range without much cover.  Some parts can be challenging but some sections feel like the base or area was emptied out for a fire drill.  Considering the previous content released I felt disappointed.  Hopefully everyone was to busy working on ME3 and gave this project to the interns to get experience.  I as a fan of the series expect greatness, stories that make you feel like you've watched a great movie or read a rich and exciting book.  This felt like I was playing an average run of the mill shooter not bad but way below what we know the talent at this studio is capable of.  I'm hoping to be absolutely blown away by ME3, but this made me nervous.  To the developers please release the masterpiece we all know you can produce not more of this kind of mediocre move from A to B open door shoot critter move to point C shoot 2 guards repeat.
