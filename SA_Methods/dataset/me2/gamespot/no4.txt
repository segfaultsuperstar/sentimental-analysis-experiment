Not the worst sequel of all time but considering what mass effect (1) accomplished i expected bioware to build on it. instead they threw everything that was good out the window and replaced it with the creatures from independence day and what is supposed to be mysterious version of data from star trek.   there are companions. most suck except tali and garrus, although garrus as a character lost alot of personality in this game. the companion quests are awful, uninteresting and predictable even to the point to where you can see what they intend to do with the choices you made. hey bioware? how about not revealing it when i made the choice and exactly how its going to play out before hand?   this game is an uninspired mess and entirely skippable as exactly nothing of any import to the overall mission or even universe happens.
