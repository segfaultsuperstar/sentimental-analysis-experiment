Really? I gave this a 4 for the reason the precedent this is trying to set. Having DLC with the release of a game is ridiculous. If its worth putting the time in to construct, make it part of the game at release. It was a nice tribute I guess, but the point of the quest which is brief is to collect a bunch of holo tags. I furthermore find collection quests absolutely a waste of time. Terrible DLC period. Only reason I didnt give it a one is I loved ME1 and its free. review.   One thing I will note about this despite the fact its not that great; I used this mission to help perk me up during the insanity run. Its a very easy way to get a few more supplies and credits. In insanity early easy missions to get any amount of supplies is key to success. You need to max yourself out before that collector ship.
