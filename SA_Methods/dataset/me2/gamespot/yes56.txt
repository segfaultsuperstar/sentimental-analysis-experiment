I'm not saying the game is bad I just wish they would have fixed a few thing or just did them differently. Because it would take to long to explain all the problems I have come across in the game I'm just going to list them.   - Insanity is way to hard to be fun, even if your character is maxed out   - Enemies ignore your allies 95% of the time and come straight for you   - Allies ignore enemies charging for you or in close proximity   - Mining is to slow   - No customization to armor or weapons   - Lack of character customization (ME1 was better, more choices)   - Story has no progression to the plot (To me ME2 ended in what was the same way as ME1. "the reapers are coming"   - Positions in some cover won't allow you to fire at the enemy   - Cover animation makes you pop your head out and become vulnerable to enemy attack   - Camera does not switch sides to allow you to see the enemy even they can see and shoot you   - Loading times are way to long   - Advancing the story with no warning and causing you make decisions you can't undo. (Spoiler......when you select a station to land on to explore the IFF cut scene automatically occurs cause your crew to be abducted and if you don't go to save them right away they will die, causing you to put whatever you were gonna do before to an end since saving the crew is part of the point of no return)   - Has nothing to do with the actual Reapers   - No more infinite ammo (the game explains that the thermal clips you use are better because they don't cause your gun to over heat yet if your gun over heats like in ME1 you can simply wait for it to cool down but running out of clips cause you to not be able to use that weapon anymore, so it seems to me that it's actually worse technology then before.   - Can't use all the weapons in the game (how can you restrict a person from using a weapon?)   - Importing a character from a completed ME2 profile still makes your lose all your Paragon and Renegade along with all your weapon and armor upgrades.   I'm sure there is more wrong with the game that I have come across but I can't think of them at the moment....
