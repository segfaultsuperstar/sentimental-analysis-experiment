Frankly, I am incensed with Bioware's balls to CHARGE us gamers for something as shallow as this, when it should have been part of the original game itself.    Just for the sake of clarity as well, I did not buy this out of protest and principle - however one of my friends did, and I played it over at his place. I figured I'd see what Bioware was offering, since he had already bitten the bullet. And let me tell you, I was glad I did not buy this, despite being a huge Mass Effect fan.   This is essentially another Zaeed - a shallow, useless character with no interaction outside their main quest. Kasumi fails to be memorable after her short (albeit amusing) quest, reduced to a few lines when clicking on things around her quarter. As someone who loves the ME series due to character interaction, this was a huge disappointment. Why even bother sticking in a character if you're not going to develop her at all?   The reason why I didn't give this a lower score is for two reasons. First off, the mission IS fun, but the fact it is so short is a big hit against it. Secondly, Kasumi is a decent regular party member, but I found this useless because I (and my friend whose account I was playing) had already beaten the game twice, and she was just an afterthought. If she had been released earlier, perhaps it would have placated me more.   I say that we as gamers should take a stand and refuse to buy crap like this on the laurels of past accomplishments. Bioware is milking us, and I think we should do something about it.
