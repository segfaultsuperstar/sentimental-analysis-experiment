Firewalker DLC brings a new vehicle to our arsenal that we can use on some spesific missions. Unlike the first game's vehicle M35 Mako, Firewalker has limited flying capacity. Diging some spesific sites for minerals, firing enemies are the other things that you can do with Firewalker.    This DLC comes with 6 missions. At first mission we grab our new vehicle and learn to use it, and after this we learn about some secrets and go after some scientists, and it takes 2-3 hours to finish.    Most disappointing thing is we cant use our characters on our missions (except the end, at the end we just walk few meters, that is all), we are just able to use Firewalker, and our team dont speak during missions even at the end.    Firewalker is a fun vehicle to use, It has great potential, but dont expect from this DLC much, after played it it gives me a sense that Bioware just made this DLC to introduce us their new vehicle and they will use it in future for other DLCs and maybe for Mass Effect 3.
