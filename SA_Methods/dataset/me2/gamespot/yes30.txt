The mine mini game completely destroys this game, feels like you game twenty minutes then spend a hour mining, feels like work not fun- it forces you to spend almost half your time tediously looking for resources- since these are needed to create upgrades you can't avoid it.  This completely stops the flow of the game.  Their leveling mechanism is cumbersome, rarely lets you level up during a mission, and leaves you with unspent points.  They cut down on available powers so you can't customize your character.  Every character class has to win as a soldier- so if you want to play another class you can, but you still win the exact same way.  In addition the game is really short- especially when you factor in how much time you are forced to waste mining.  Game just feels like the "B" team worked on it.  Will try ME3 when it comes out- but will rent not buy.
