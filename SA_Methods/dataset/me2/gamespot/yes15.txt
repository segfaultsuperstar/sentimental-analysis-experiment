A long time fan of the Mass Effect Universe, I looked forward to this final installment that was to bridge the gap from ME2 to the upcoming ME3.  Arrival was supposed to be that bridge, but instead ends up being about a 2 hour interactive trailer that is short on substance and filled with bugs.  Instead of letting you make what should have been significant decisions, the game instead makes these for you and leaves you watching as Shepard reluctantly moves the plot forward, unable to stop or even alter it.   The highlights of Arrival is still the combat sequences, but the AI seems to have suffered some mental lapses as enemies too often charge past you to your companion letting you shoot them in the back.  A final desperation escape sequence turns the end of the game into a run and gun shooting gallery.   In the words of Marlon Brando - 'It coulda been a contender', but instead it's just a fizzling end to one of the greatest games ever.
