What on earth have they done to the first game? I played that through and admittedly some bits in ME2 are better, overall the game is nowhere near as good.   I am not saying this isn't a decent game because it is, it is just nowhere near as much fun as ME1. If I hadn't played that first I would have been extremely impressed with ME2.   The story is VERY linear, the text is so small I ended up with sore eyes for hours after playing, and virtually everything I did in ME1 has no bearing on ME2.....I could go on...   Character Migration - I know you get some resources when you migrate a character from ME1, but I was level 43 on that and to suddenly be back to level 1 with no decent equipment is a real pain.    There doesn't seem to be any stats for weapons any more....just some description that doesn;t really give you any idea of whether your new rifle is better than your current one. You have to make a guess...   The Level Up function is now really basic, and I am often left with a development point left over. Your Charm stat now comes from your Paragon level, and is not developed at all.   I could go on and on but you are probably getting the picture.   As I said at the start...I do not dislike this game; I actually think it is quite good, but it is nowhere near as good as the first one. Lots may disagree and they are totally entitled to their opinion....just as I am entitled to mine..... This seems to be a very lazy sequel to what was a very good first game.
