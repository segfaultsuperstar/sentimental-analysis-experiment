It's a standard mission that should have been included with the game.  Kasumi is a useful character if your still working on the quest so I would recommend you download it and complete it early so you get your money's worth out of the character.  The locales are pretty cool and the acquired gun is good, plus you get to find out what happened to some of the world's most famous works of art, but I don't think it's enough to warrant the price.  I downloaded it before I finished the game, but I would definitely avoid it if you're looking for a reason to go and play some more.  Hopefully there will be a much meatier DLC installment in the future.
