I don't see what's so great about this game - everything about it seems generic to me. I mean it's a tunnel shooter. Are we living in the age of mediocricity?   I tried ME1 but it wouldn't load on my pc.   I love good sci-fi movies but now that I think I haven't played a single space sci-fi game that I really liked. Well, No One Lives Forever had a great mission (like all its missions) that took place in a space station, but that's about it. Starcraft? I thought it was mediocre too.   So somehow I knew that this game wouldn't impress me. The ideas that are used in this game have been recycled endless times. There's nothing new. It's the same game over and over. So I have to choose one answer from three in the dialogue - every time? I mean it's ok when the choice affects if the character will join me fighting a boss or something, but to always have numerous choises just for the sake of it - I find it very annoying, I would rather do nothing and watch a cutscene, rather than read generic sentences that have no value and then choose one of them, ugh.   But most importantly - this game has no drive, it has been made with no enthusiasm, and I can understand that - the developers are tired, they have nothing to offer anymore, so the mystery why this perfectly average game is so loved remains.
