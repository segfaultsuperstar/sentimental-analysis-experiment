I can't say it is a bad game: Far from that. However I don't understand skyhigh ratings the reviewers have been giving it. As for myself, it is high expectations to blame, but I didn't find any superlatives, especially comparing to its predecessor. All too similar fights. Levels are nothing special, already seen too many tims. The game is short of a vehicle, which was a welcome part of the first one. The script, although complex is pretty average too. Nice, but then again not very impressive graphics etc. The game however deserves praise for its job on multitude of characters. On the positive side it also runs smoothly, loads quickly, no major bugs, interaction is done nicely, dialogues and voice acts sound convincing. Maybe it shouldn't be published as part two, just an extension to the Mass Effect.
