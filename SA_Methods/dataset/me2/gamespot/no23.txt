I cannot display the massive boredom that I have experienced playing this nice looking, mock-able story, and Boring game, Gameplay did not appeal to me at all, it felt like it tryed to copy a gears of war style but failed short, I wasn't impressed and apparently Commander Shepard is the only person in the UNIVERSE who is macho enough to take down a race of invincible ships. (lol) I was also disgusted when I came to find that the game had a sex scene. Probably a sad attempt to get more people interested in this 'game'. On top of the boring gameplay and talking to random people there are these frustrating mining minigames that are impossible to beat and vehicle levels that feature abysmal controls. (honestly did they even test those levels?)   Anyways I don't know why this game got such high ratings when call of duty is the obvious better choice I rate this terrible game a 5 out of 10 for this reason.
