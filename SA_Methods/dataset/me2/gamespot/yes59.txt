I think that I may have just reached some kind of internal biological limit on the number of times I can play a Space Marine.  I see a pulsing crate ahead, but unless it contains a Bioshock 2 installer I just don't give a s**t anymore.     Also, I don't feel like I'm anywhere at all in this game.  It's every cliche of what running around a spaceship is supposed to look like.  Rapture was a place.  Liberty city was a place. Even Arkham Asylum was a place, albeit a derivative one.  This is just nowhere.  The linearity seems like a conspicuously dated style of game-play at this point.  Contemporary games usually do a better job of dispersing spawn-points and staggering their triggers.     I will say that Miranda is a piece of ass.  Some subtle boob physics would be nice since currently her space-spandex is frozen as if made of marble.  Voice acting is decent, and sometimes great.
