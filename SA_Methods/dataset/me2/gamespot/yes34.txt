Like the Zaeed DLC, if the Normandy Crash Site (NCS) wasn't free it would not even be worth downloading. At the moment of this review, these two DLC's are the only ones available for ME2.   NCS is a touching homage to ME1, and shows the typical stunning visuals that mark ME2 as an absolutely fantastic game. The whole side-quest should last you about 5 to 10 minutes, even if you spend 2 to 3 of them gazing at the visuals and wreckage.   [Spoilers WARNING]   However, aside from a few cut-scenes of ME1 footage and an annoying little side quest involving picking up a number of dog tags and resources, there is nothing really to it.   [Spoilers END HERE]   If there hasn't been any new DLC since the writing of this review and you've picked up ME2 second hand, don't bother downloading the Cerberus network card. Zaeed and NCS are really fluff compared to the rest of the game. If you do have the Cerberus network card, have fun, just don't expect anything overly amazing.
