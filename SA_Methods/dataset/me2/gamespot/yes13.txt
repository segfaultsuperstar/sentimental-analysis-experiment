I bought this DLC for two reasons.  The first is that it was touted as an important story bridge between ME2 and ME3.  The second is that I really enjoyed Lair of the Shadow Broker and Stolen Memory.  As I really enjoy the story of ME and the quality of the those other two DLCs I decided to get Arrival.   In retrospect, I probably could have done without this DLC, even as a huge fan of the series.  I just beat it now and went to read the ME Wiki entry on it.  I realize I could have gotten virtually the same story insights and feel just from reading the text there.  I know that in DLCs like these, they don't hire back the rest of the voice cast so there won't be any new lines or dialogue from any of the other characters in the game.  Instead, there's a lot of reading of codex entries and logs and some semi-interesting dialogue between Shepard (at least they get Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale in) and Admiral Hackett.  But otherwise, there wasn't much there.     The action was fairly intense for me playing on Veteran difficulty mostly because you are by yourself for virtually the entire DLC.  Taking down a YMIR solo is pretty challenging.  In the end though, i just didn't feel very satisfied by this.  I don't know if it will have implications for ME3 in terms of importing your save, which is actually a third reason for purchasing it.  But if those three things don't appeal to you, then I would say just read the entry in the ME wiki to find out what happened and save your $7.
