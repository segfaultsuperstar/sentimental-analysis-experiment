												Will Steam or Bioware someday release a 'ME2 - Complete Edition'?? If not, don't buy it, the game is like 9,5/10, but if you start playing Mass Effect 3 (which is not available on Steam) without playing through ME2 DLC's (like i did x.x) which are only obtainable on bioware store via points purchase (lameÂ²), you'll really lose a great bit of the plot there, and it will compromise your experience.PS: i don't know if it's only on steam version, but i got wallstucked like 5 times in the game, and had to restart from checkpoint, it's full of bugs!
