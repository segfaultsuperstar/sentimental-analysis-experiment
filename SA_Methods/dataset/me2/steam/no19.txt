												Should be called 'Bonus Version' instead 'Deluxe Edition'.Is a complete ripoff. None of the big DLC's are included, only some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons and armor. Once you buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 'Deluxe Edition', you wil be expected to buy the DLC that should have been included, such as Overlord, Zaeed and Shadow Broker. This game is pure thievery, how does EA sleep at night without horse tranquilizers?I alreay have the Xbox 360 version with all DLC, which is much better than this comeplet ♥♥♥♥ of the wallet. ♥♥♥♥ you EA.
