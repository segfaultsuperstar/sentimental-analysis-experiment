												While the game is great, i simply cannot accept EA's decision to not publish everything on steam and let people make the choice of where they buy, if they have to strongarm people into buying stuff on their website or through Origin, it should show just how much of a piece of crap move it is... EA / Bioware is dead as far as i'm concerned and there never was anything after what was released on Steam ;)
