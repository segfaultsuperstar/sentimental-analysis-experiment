												Mass Effect 1 was decent for it's time, but it's hell going from ME2, to ME1. The mechanics, the controls, and the play style changed rather drastically from 1 to 2 where in 1 everything actually had damage, in 2 it's more about "What gun do I like more and works for how I play" but then ME3 brought back the "damage" by giving it damage bars.The skill sets are niceThe combat is decentBut the story. That's what'll keep you around. The storyline for this I'll admit, is a little cliche at some points, but all in all ME2 was a huge step up from ME1, making ME1 a pain to play again just to get different choices.Get the ME2 Deluxe Edition, you can use the new start mode to make choices from ME1, without needing to actually play through ME1.Wanna see gameplay and choices for ME1, head to Youtube.
