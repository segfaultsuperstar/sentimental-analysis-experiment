												Well gosh I'm sure glad I spent the extra money on the digital deluxe edition EVEN THOUGH NONE OF THE DIGITAL DELUXE CONTENT WORKS ON STEAM AND THIS HAS BEEN PUBLIC INFORMATION SINCE AT LEAST 2016Seriously why is steam selling the DDE, they are literally scamming everyone who buys it because none of the content works outside of origin now, it couldn''t be that hard to remove it or at least add a disclaimer that you're not actually getting anything else for the extra price.
