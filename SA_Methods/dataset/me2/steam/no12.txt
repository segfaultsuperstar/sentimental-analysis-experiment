												One of the best story games ever. Yeah, you read it right. I DO recommend this game, but NOT on steam because you won't be able to buy the dlcs(there are some important dlcs, believe me) or even continue the series since Steam has cut ties with EA. In my opinion, this game is the best if you play from ME 1 until the end (ME3).But... If you don't really mind not playing the sequel or buy any dlcs, then go ahead (although it wouldn't be worth it buying alone) Pros: 1. One of the first(if not THE FIRST) story-based game series where you get to make bonds with your extraterrestrial comrades and friends 2. Heavily story based3. A decision making gameCons: 1. Steam doesn't have the sequel game, the Origin does.P.S : I do know that the game does allow you to transfer the save files to the sequel, and that you can buy the dlcs at their own website. When I said you can't, I meant you can't buy the complete trilogy and all the dlcs in Steam. And have a complete set of your favorite game trilogy
