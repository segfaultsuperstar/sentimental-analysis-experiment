												Amazing game with an awesome story. My only advice is don't play it right after you finish part 1. The gameplay is so different that you might be turned off by it at first. At least I was. If you didn't like the loot system in part 1, then you're in good hands, as Mass Effect 2 ditches the loot sytem in favor of upgrades, constant upgrades. It's fun, amazing, but part of me always missed the loot system. The story wasn't as engaging as part 1, but still amazing fun. Enjoy
