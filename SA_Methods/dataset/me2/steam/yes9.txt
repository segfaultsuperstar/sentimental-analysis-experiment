												One of the best games ever made.  Better than it's predecessor and better than it's sequel, this is Mass Effect at it's best.  Extremely cinematic, yet the gameplay is fun and the decisions feel meaningful.  The cast of characters makes the game, and the voice acting is top notch - as long as you play Femshep, the only true Shepard!
