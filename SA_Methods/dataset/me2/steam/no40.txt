												Don't buy it now, as good as the game is EA decided to shut down their online services for it so none of the payed-for DLC can work! If you want to play through it now I'd reccoment slogging through the first one just to get here so your choices actually have an affect. I really despise this company and how they force players to have to use back-ends to fix their games.
