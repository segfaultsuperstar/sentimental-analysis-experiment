												Ive played through this game many times and enjoyed it greatly. The problem is the dlc I had purchased is all gone. When steam removed the dlc as available from their website all previously purchased dlc was removed as well, which makes me unable to access old saves.....  I know have to repurchase product that I had already paid for just to continue on files I had been replaying on. I can no longer recommend this game on steam as a result. I know this is likely not their fault and just more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t from EA.
