												ME2 is a good game. Vote is for EA/Origin & Steam.DLC content is not included in the install, only keys for it. Requires navigating the EA/Origin site to register the keys to DOWNLOAD the DLC to install it. Apparently did this a few years ago when I purchased it. Email address hasn't changed, account still existed, content attached to account did not.This is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and as a result, I will *never buy* another EA game. Will also never buy a game which has a similar bait and switch method to retrieve content from another source.
