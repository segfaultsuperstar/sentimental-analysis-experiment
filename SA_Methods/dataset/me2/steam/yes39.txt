												A masterpiece. The scope of it, the story, characters, settings, even the music, everything about the game is top notch. Best of the trilogy and one of the best games ever. Bought it here on Steam when it first came out, even today still has great replay value. 270+ hours I've played it.If there is one thing I could criticize, it's the lack of native gamepad support out of the box. Fortunately there are third party mods that add controller support.
