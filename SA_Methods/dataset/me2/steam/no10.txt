												DO NOT buy this game on Steam. EA has disconnected the DLC key redeeming website, and you will have paid for nothing. If you want to play it, just buy Origin Access for 5 dollars less and it gets you the whole damn collector's edition series. This is one of my favorite games of all time, and I'm so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I wasted money on defunct keys.
