												My favorite game series so far! I'd recommend this to anyone who likes games with great story , voices , music and of course awesome gameplay!I played out Mass Effect one 4 times, Mass Effect 2 7 times and Mass Effect 3 8 times (2015.10.08 - will edit if anything will changeEDIT: 2016.11.23 - +1 trilogy playthrough)I'd spent around 250-300 hours in the series so far (more on Origin) and still love to come back and play the game again and again!
