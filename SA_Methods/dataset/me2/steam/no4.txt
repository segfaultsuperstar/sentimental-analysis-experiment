												DO NOT BUY THISThe "Deluxe" edition does not include ANY of the story DLC, Wanna know why? Because EA does not support ANY dlcs for either Mass Effect 1 or 2 on platforms outside their own, EA only provides CD-keys to steam which are then delivered to you on purchase, You have to download their Origin launcher and pay even more to actually play the full version of Mass Effect 2, Its absolutely disgusting and abhorent. Don't give the festering pile of feces that is EA any money, Just put on your tricorne and eyepatch instead.
