My personal review for Mass Effect 2.This review has been made with the intent of having as little spoilers as possible, but it's inevitable. Read with caution.Short Plot Synopsis: Mass Effect 2 takes place weeks after the first game, starting with Commander Shepard (Mark Meer or Jennifer Hale) and the crew of the Normandy searching through a sector where three ships have gone missing within one month. After spending four days finding nothing, the Normandy is attacked by an unknown ship, ripping it apart. The crew evacuates, and Commander Shepard tosses Jeff "Joker" Moreau (Seth Green), the ship's pilot, into the last available Evacuation Pod. Shepard is thrown aside from the pod to a control panel, where he closes off the Evac Pod and sends Joker to safety. However, an explosion damages Shepard's suit, causing a breach, leaving Shepard to ultimately asphyxiate and fall into the nearby planet. Shortly after death, a company named Cerberus, that has a bad reputation for extremist behaviours to secure the fate of Humanity, recovers Shepard's body from the surface of the planet. Cerberus then creates and begins the "Lazarus Project", the act to revive Shepard. The process takes two years, and Shepard's awakening wasn't pleasant. When he finally awakens, alarm bells are going off in the Research Station. The ship's own Security Mechs have turned rogue, and the ship needs to be evacuated. This begins Mass Effect 2.Features:           - Re-take the role of Commander Shepard, defeater of Saren and saviour of the Citadel, and control him through the events of Mass Effect 2.           - Carry off from where you left off; Choices from Mass Effect 1 affect Mass Effect 2. You can also import your previous character. You are also able to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, where your decisions will affect the story and your crew. Though it involves a little bit of work, details later on.           - Every choice matters; Whether it's delaying a mission, or helping out your crew, every decision will influence your outcome and determine your crew's fate.           - Personalization; You can shape Shepard into your own view of them, making Shepard either Male or Female, and having control over their looks, personality, armour style, class, abilities, and weapons.           - Moral System; The Mass Effect series has a moral compass with two sides; Paragon and Renegade. However, unlike numerous other moral compases that determines being either one or the other, Mass Effect brings a new idea to the table. It tracks both your Paragon and Renegade sides at the same time, meaning if you choose to spare someone, but extort someone for a discount, sparing that person will not balance out your moral compass. Unlike Mass Effect, there is no more Charm or Intimidate skill. They are now determined solely by your Paragon and Renegade standings, respectfully. Having enough Moral Standing points, you can then use special dialogue options, as well as a new feature introduced in Mass Effect 2 called "Interrupts". These are special dialogue options used when other characters are talking, activated with the mouse buttons. Using these can cause impacts on the story, such as calming down two characters before they end up fighting, point out other characters immoral choices, or even assault a character entirely. Another interesting feature is your moral standing affects Shepard's appearance. If you choose a Paragon path, Shepard's scars from the Lazarus Project will heal and start to disappear. However, if you choose Renegade, those scars will deepen and show more.           - A wide crew, made of different races. Your personal squad, who will assist in battle, is interchangable, and comes with the ability with choosing their loadout and abilities. If you do your squadmate's loyalty missions, they will gain a unique ability, and this will help with the end-game.           - The ability to use your teammates abilities when you want to.           - Unique, original plot, with lots of mechanics you can't find elsewhere.           - The universe is vast, full of interesting species and races, each with their own quirks and personalities.           - You are able to create relationships with your crew members, that will affect the story in the next game.           - Has a Planet-Scanning mini-game, where you search for different minerals and possibly side-missions on different planets.           - New hacking minigames, including connecting Matching Pins and selecting matching pieces of code.           - New Game+ Mode.           - And many more features.Pros           + Many customizable character and armour features. You are able to shape Shepard into your own image of him/her, choose your own class with their own set of abilities, choose your backstory, personalize your armour with different material and patterns, and mix-and-match armour pieces. Each piece of armour also has different effects, meaning one helmet could grant extra health, while another could improve accuracy.           + Deep story, with a fair amount of lore. The developers specifically noted to make the side-quests as deep as the main story.           + Every choice matters, each with their own consequences. Will characters agree with your actions, or frown upon them?           + Many new characters, each with their own detailed backstory.           + Brings back old characters from Mass Effect 1, with their own story of what they've been up to since Shepard had died.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 1 character into Mass Effect 2, with all the decisions you have made in the first game affecting the story in the second one.           + The ability to import your Mass Effect 2 character into Mass Effect 3, though this comes with a little bit of work. Again, I'll explain further in.           + The outcome will be entirely determined on the player's decisions.           + Able to interact with and get to know your crew. You will be able to do specific missions for them, to gain their loyalty, unlocking a specific ability for them.           + Like I said in the features, Mass Effect has a very unique plot and story, with mechanics found hardly anywhere else.           + Nice graphics, even for a 5 year old game. It even runs smoothly for the amount of effects it has.           + The Mass Effect series has had a Heavy influence on lots of sci-fi games.Neutral           +- You won't find yourself short on Credits anytime soon. Every mission is funded by Cerberus, and will include at least a 20,000 credit payroll at the end of the mission. You can also find additional credits on PDA's, Terminals, Wall Safe's, and (for some reason), Medi-kits. However, Purchases are evened out to higher prices to even this out.           +- "I'm Commander Shepard, and this is my favourite store on the Citadel." You can endorse numerous stores on the Citadel with this line, which could technically create conflicts. It has no effect on the game though. However, this isn't a good way of laying low if you choose to tell the security guards at the entrance you would prefer the records to state that Shepard has died. Again, endorsing numerous stores has no effect on that choice.           +- It requires a little bit of work to transfer your ME2 save file to ME3, due to ME3 only being available to Origin.Cons           - The game has DLC, but it's not available on Steam.           - If Shepard dies in the end-game, you can not import your save to ME3.           - Mini-games can get repetitive.Final DecisionI highly recommend this game. Mass Effect had a large impact on the Sci-Fi genre, and for good reason. I'll admit I had to cut a few points due to character limit, but I covered most of it. This is a fantastic game series, 8.9/10.
