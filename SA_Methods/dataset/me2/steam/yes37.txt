												I just finished the entire Mass Effect series—with ALL the DLC—and it was #EPIC! With all the DLC and having to purchase ME3 via Origin, I dropped a decent amount of change in comparison to the sale price I paid on Steam for both ME and ME2. That being said, this was the best series I've ever played—and WILL play through again. 150+ hrs well played.
