												This game just does everything right.  Playing through the first ME is a must and any annoyances about that game are worth powering through to reach this gem.  Story and characters aside, gameplay is vastly improved from the first Mass Effect (Except from the new way Medigel works). Aside from that, though, absolutely unmissable.  (DLC is great also).
