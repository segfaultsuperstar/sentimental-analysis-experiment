												What follows is my opinion and I can see I will definetely be in the minority on this. I loved the first game in this series because of its RPG elements. But in ME2 they decided to make it more into a third-person shooter and reduce some of the RPG elements. I'm not really looking for another third-person shooter because there are hundreds of them and others that do it better. I liked how the first one had a simplified combat system and although many of its systems and mechanics were not perfect they just needed some tweaking not a complete overhaul. I find many of the screens and UIs from the first game easier and faster to navigate/gather info where as the screens in the second game I find difficult and annoying. It seems like the majority of people love this game and that is good for them but I have no interest in playing this game to completion like I did with the first.
