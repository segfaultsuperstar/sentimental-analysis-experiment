												I recommend the game--just not as a digital download. The buying options on Steam are misleading (I don't think this is Steam's fault, I believe it is more of an issue with how Bioware chose to package their content); Buying the "Digital Deluxe Edition" DOES NOT include ALL in-game content. NONE of the DLCs are packaged into the "Digital Deluxe Edition." And NONE of the DLC is purchasable on Steam. This is NOT readily apparent unless you carefully read the description on Steam. Furthermore, to access the alleged extras in this DDE version, you must make a Bioware account, find the proper pages, download the alleged extras manually, and install manually before you can play them. I originally played ME 2 on PS3, having bought a disk edition that had all the DLCs included. That is your best bet for this game unfortunately. If you buy the digital download, by the time you have all the content (vanilla game + DLCs) you will be sinking WAY more money into Bioware's money grubbing hands then this 6+ year old game is worth.
