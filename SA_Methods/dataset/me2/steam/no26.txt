												Just get it on Origin if you REALLY want it that bad.EA are a bunch of stingy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and they'll never release Mass Effect 3 or Dragon Age 2 or Inq on Steam because they want you to go download Origin and get it from them directly. So that means the carrying over from game to game bit that makes all of these games so loveable is almost completely lost on the Steam versions because EA is refusing to finish the trifecta so as to strongarm you into buying it straight from the source. And don't even get me STARTED on the DLCs.... they made those SO hard to integrate.
