												What no one seems to mention is almost none of the DLC is included even after all this time. Not once, and I don't mean like it feels like it, I literally mean not a single damn time has the DLC ever gone on sale, it's still the same exact price it ever was and you have to go through Bioware.com to get it.You have no idea how much that pisses me off.It's one of my favorite games of all time too, it really makes me sad that after all this time Bioware can't just give us a complete version without needing to drop what is now more then the price of entry to get the full story that can be played. So freaking selfish.Remind me to never buy a EA game on sale without doing my homework ever again, let my failing be your lesson, my friends.Since someone was "nice" enough to ask for it, Here is my full review.                                                Mass Effect 2One of my favorite games of all time. I’ve played it from beginning to end, probably somewhere upwards of three to four times at least. I’ve owned it on both PC and PS3 before. In fact I still have some DLC from both versions through Bioware.comThere’s a lot to love here. It was an expansive sequel to Mass Effect that in your choices from the first game show up here, the gameplay was radically improved upon and the game just looks absolutely stunning!                                                        StoryFrom a storytelling point of view this game is absolutely gaming fodder. In the tradition of the best RPGs you go out looking for your merry (well some of them are merry at least) group of followers. It’s got almost a Seven Samurai vibe going on here. You have to hunt down an assassin whom is forever cursed with the ability to relieve any of his memories perfectly forever. A loyal space marine haunted by the fate of what ever happened to his father. The loyal (or is she?) right hand woman to the corporation that has brought you back from brink of death itself. Old friends and some interesting new ones are met as well.                                   It feels like a good bottle of port.                              Very smooth and relaxing to take it all in.Without spoiling anything major story wise, I’ll just say it added to it in all the right ways. Really made the game shine giving you so much more immersion you really end up wanting to play through to find out how your choices unfold and where these characters might end up.                                   Sets a great stage for the last game.                                                   Presentation                                            Well, it sure is pretty.The difference here is akin to comparing Witcher 1 to Witcher 3. It holds up remarkably well with age. It looks like it could come out today on the PC. My only gripe would be it could with a small update give us a wee bit more access to under the hood settings wise but that may be a tad unrealitic of me of Bioware. The game sizzles with amazing on screen effects, sound is really the main winner here though. Voice acting is the bar other games should set for itself. This game is pretty much one of the best voiced games I’ve ever heard to this day, easily in my top five. Witcher 3 and The Walking Dead season 1 edge it out just barely here in my book.                                                     GameplayOooo, it’s really fun this time around. It’s a cover shooter for sure, it has RPG underpinnings. Think small but powerful skill trees that equal up to either amazing combat abilties or skills to be used in game to help turn events or avoid combat all together, almost somewhere between Deus Ex and Call of Duty. It’s a lot of fun. It’s a squad based game so you almost always have a few allies in the thick of it with you which is really fun and makes combat managable but never impossible. I would say if you like action games, with light tactical consideration this a great contender for you.                                                    Lasting appeal.                                         Well it’s obviously a classic.I don’t particular enjoy the 3rd game which this one builds up towards well. So that's not what hesitates me to recommend this edition of Mass Effect 2. That would be like hating on Empire for Return.  That being said I’ve owned it multiple times which is something I don’t do often. It is a blast to play. But once again, my primary hesitation here is the lack of DLC missing from the current editions. The DLC is amazing content but after so many years it’s still just missing from the game they currently sell via steam and also on consoles. They don't label this at all. Which to me is deceiving. It’s their choice to charge full price after all these years for something that actually fills in plot holes story wise. I really want to recommend this game to you but it kills me a little bit inside how much I and many others have already given them money wise that they won’t just give people this content for free or at least at a huge price cut after almost seven years. I want you to have it I just don't want you to spend almost 30 dollars plus the cost of the base game to get it!   I refuse to pay more than I paid for the game itself for all this content. That and some of the content I bought in the past is missing from my Bioware account no less (not all of it but Lair of the Shadow Broker for example). I would go on but my first review is my honest reaction to buying this game only to find out after the return policy ran out that I have to rebuy content for a seven year old game not via steam but throguh an almost ancient website by todays standards and drop almost thirty dollars for story content (and that's not even all the content). Take what you will from this review and just know that I’m just trying to be honest with you about how this whole thing made me feel so that at the very least you might make a more informed decision then I did.
