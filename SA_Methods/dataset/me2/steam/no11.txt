												The game itself is good but too many parts of the storyline comes in form of dlc, this would not be a problem or particulary strange if those dlc were available via steam but they are not.To get the real full pack you have to access to the clunky bioware shop, yes their own shop not even EA's Origin, where this dlc is stored. If this anoyance was not enough those dlc on biowares shop have not had a price drop since launch, neither have they had any sort of sale as steams does time to time, actually there isn't even a "get all the dlc" pack deal.I was looking forward to finish the trilogy but I don't want to play an incomplete game and neither I'm willing to pay for the "additional content" several times what I paid for the supposed core game. I feel cheated by this pricing policies and have decided to draw my line here. I'm sorry bioware but for me mass effect ended with the first installement.
