												I feel that comparisions to the original game is necessary when writing a review for Mass Effect 2, so here it goes:1. Like Mass Effect, Mass Effect 2 is a story-rich 3rd-person FPS where you play as Commander Sheperd. However, the story was not as captivating as ME1 and it seemed that I spent more time assembling and gaining the loyalty of my crew than on the main campaign, which in retrospect was pretty short and straightforward.2. The combat system was an improvement from ME1, where it was much easier to utilise abilities (both yours and your squad's) by binding them to the numerical keys. However, combat got really repetitive after a while. The hacking/ bypassing system was also an improvement, although mostly unnecessary and also repetitive. 3. Anyone who played the original game would remember the dreadfully long elevator rides. Thankfully, ME2 had smoother transitioning and also higher quality cut-scenes which were very enjoyable.4. Like in ME1, it was possible to flirt/ develop relationships with a number of crewmates, although you would have to complete your target's loyalty quest before you could express interest. However, I was disappointed when Liara (ME1 character) could not be recruited into my squad, even though she did make an appearance in the game.I gave ME1 a rating of 9.5/10 only because of the elevator rides. While ME2 was a good game, it seemed to be lacking in story and also its descent into repetitiveness. 8.5/10
