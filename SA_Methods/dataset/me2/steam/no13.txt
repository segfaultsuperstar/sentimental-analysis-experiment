												The only reason i say no is because theres 22 DLC for this game. Yes thats right, 22 and buying this version provides only 6 i believe. Not worth it because some of the DLC is really important and has squadmates you can add to your roster. Game is awesome, but Digital Deluxe edition doesn't give you what you need. You're probably better off buying it on Origin which may or may not have all DLC but it does have the Trilogy. i think some of the dlc is only possible to get via illegal means but i'm the type of gamer that feels a game is only complete if you have all of its tid-bits. and in this bundle, you do not. purchase elsewhere.also, if you have steam version of the game, some things like Pinnacle Station DLC for mass effect 1 won't work. So don't get too excited if you bought the steam version of mass effect, then download dlc from Bioware and have difficulty making it work.
