												I finally beat this game and I definitely enjoyed myself. I don't like the combat as much but that's because I'm weird. Most people prefer ME2's combat to ME1's. My only real issue-- mind you, it's a pretty huge one-- with this game is that the DLC in this digital deluxe edition literally does not work because of the way it has to be activated. The server you have to go through is dead and you can't even activate it outside of the game. Unless you're willing to do what I did and look for a DLC enabler to work around this issue, I'd suggest you get it from Origin instead. Even if you've installed all of the DLC and it is LITERALLY in your game files waiting to be used, the game refuses to activate it. The only two ways to get around this are to get a DLC enabler (which is sketchy, legally, and kind of a pain in the butt to get working) or to get the game from Origin, which everyone hates. So, do I recommend this game? Yeah, sure. It's fun. Do I recommend the Steam Digital Deluxe Edition? No.
