												I can finally sprint outside of combat.---edit---I am greatly disappointed in one thing though, this version does not include some of the dlc. For example, the PS3 version included all of the dlc's such as the Lair of the Shadowbroker (which is hands down one fo the best dlc's ever), the extra character Kasumi, etc. This version only has Zaeed and a few weapons. When I found out it would likely cost me another $20 USD for the rest of the dlc, it left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I was hoping it would be the same version as the ps3 release, but it's not.If you have a ps3, you can get the fully-loaded copy of it for $11 on amazon. It's a must better deal than this, since all of the exra dlc's must be bought through Bioware/EA's website, and there are no sales on those dlc's from what I've seen.This game is one of my favorite RPG's ever. The game itself is absolutely fantastic, and with all the dlc's, there is a TON of content to enjoy. I'm giving it a negative review, because I thought it had all of the content for it, and it does not. There is nothing deluxe about it. Just a few free gimmicks, and a link to another site where you'll have to sink about another $20 to get the rest of the good content.So it's really a question of value. $11USD for all of the content for PS3, or $40-$50USD (when not on sale) for PC. How they can still charge this much, when I got the PS3 version years ago for $20CAD is beyond me.(yet another edit)I was wrong about how much the cost of the DLC is. I just checked how many bioware points it would cost for me to purchase all of the remaining DLC for this game through EA's Origin service. 3600 points. Which equates to being $45-$50USD. It's just ridiculous that it would cost this much for a game that is this old. Yes, it's still a fantastic game. One of my all-time favorites. But the price is just insane, meanwhile an outdated ps3 system has all of the content for a fraction of the price.
