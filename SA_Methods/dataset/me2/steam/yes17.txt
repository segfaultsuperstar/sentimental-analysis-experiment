												I used to think Mass Effect 1 was the best in the series, and used to be very biased toward it. After recently playing through Mass Effect 2 though, I have to say that I think this one is the best in the series. While I do miss a lot of the RPG aspects that Mass Effect 1 offered, and were removed from Mass Effect 2, I think the overall improvements to Mass Effect 2 overshadow that. The TPS aspects are way more solid, and feel a lot tighter. They also added an ammo system to the game and removed the heat aspect. While I did enjoy the heat aspect of Mass Effect 1, and figuring out ways to manage it, the ammo system works out in the end. I may also be one of the only ones that actually enjoyed using the Mako, but even though it was replaced in this game with a scan type of thing on planets, it makes it a lot more streamlined. Overall, the story and storytelling is awesome in Mass Effect 2. Everything in Mass Effect 2 is more streamlined, and feels a lot more solid compared to Mass Effect 1. It's a great game, and I definitely recommend it to fans of Mass Effect 1, or just fans of deep storylines, and Shooter/RPG fans.
