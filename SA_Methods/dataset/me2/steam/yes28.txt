												Most definitely the best sci-fi action-rpg ever made. Despite the lack of excitement of the first installment of the series, this sequel was the game of the year at 2010 IMHO. Also the moral details and characterization is way beyond other games. In short, this is a whole great experience whether you like the genre or not.
