												Installed, just fine.  The problem is with steam (no surprise).  It gives me a ME2 digital deluxe promo key, a digital deluxe cerberus key and a digital deluxe game key.Surprise!  You have to make an account with Bioware, but luckily I already had one.  Key 1 - accepted.  Key 2 - denied, you must pay bioware money to activate this.  Key 3 - invalid.Oh, and forget about transferring your data from ME1 to ME2 even though it is supported. Not happy...  but i'll just play it and forget about all the DLC I just missed out on, but was promised in the package I bought.  Thanks again steam...Almost forgot, the 'help' link on this page in case you need assistance? Broken link.
