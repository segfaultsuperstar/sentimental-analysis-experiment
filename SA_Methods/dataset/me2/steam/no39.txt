												Can't recommend Steam version of this game due to lacking DLC support from EA for non-Origin versions. DLC available on Steam does not cover important side stories  relevant to Mass Effect 3 and Mass Effect cannon. This version (I think) also requires you to have origin account and redeem keys bought through Steam which is a drag.Otherwise it's a fairly good addition to the world of Mass Effect.
