 This has been by far one of the best games I've played in a few years. I really got involved with the characters and liked every one of them. Granted, I don't think this game is for everyone, and probably isn't as universal as people are making it out to be. However, if you want a great action game with a decent plot and good voice over work, this is your baby.
