 Mass Effect 2 did not disappoint. In my opinion it is better than the first game. The controls seem easier to me, and I like the fact that there is a lot more action and less dragged out dialogue. Also i feel there are some truly memorable moments that really bring you into the story. Over all I give this a 10.
