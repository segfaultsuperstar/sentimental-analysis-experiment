 This game is beyond perfect. I love RPG's and Bioware outdid themselves once again! This is, as said, more of a shooter than a hardcore RPG. That said, it doesn't remove any of the fun you've experienced in other RPG's. There is some slight design problems though, the game misses some hotkeys (standard for journal, squad etc). I don't get why people are complaining about switching weapons though. No, there is no direct hotkeys, but you can scroll, and you can also use tactical-pause to switch weapons like in the first game. Works perfect. I do however miss the equipment handling from the first game, having to decide what bullet/weapon/armor modifiers to use etc. Also, I don't get why they won't allow same gender romances, I want Miranda! ;) The thermal clips (ammo instead of overheat?) works fine, it's not nearly as disturbing as i thought it would be. In short, 10/10. The game is beautiful and well worth the Deluxe Edition money I paid for it. Those minor flaws I named doesn't come nearby anything that could reduce the score. Brilliant Game.
