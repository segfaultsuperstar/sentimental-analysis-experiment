 I've played all of bioware's games since they came out and I have to say Mass Effect 2 is not only my favorite bioware product, it's my favorite game of all time. While there are a few issues with the PC version, it's not enough to take away from the experience. This game submerses you into the story, when you aren't play it, you want to be. This game has a movie like effect on you, yet still is a great RPG/Shooter. Those who are hardcore RPGERs or Shooters won't like it. Those who value games for the experience at hand this is IT. I honestly get no joy from any of the other games I play now. Great characters, especially Thane. If you take it for what it is it's 10/10. If you're looking for a by the book RPG, look elsewhere.
