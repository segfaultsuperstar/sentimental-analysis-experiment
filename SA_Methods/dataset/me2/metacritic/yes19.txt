 Biowares second foray into the Mass Effect universe is a brilliant Sci-Fi RPG that fixes everything about Mass Effect 1 and attempts to finally pull computer RPG's (kicking and screaming) away from the pen and paper roots that have held them back over recent years. Bioware casts aside the usual character development conventions of yesteryear and daringly challenges the player to define their characters not by loot and stats but by actions and interactions with npc's and the game world itself. Of course change is usually met with apprehension and sometimes open hostility. The stat and random number generator crowd decry ME2 as not a real RPG, but i would say it may be the first true computer RPG, where your character is truly defined by his actions and not some color coded piece of loot that requires 20 strength to use. Kudos to Bioware for bravely challenging convention and bringing crpg's into the modern era.
