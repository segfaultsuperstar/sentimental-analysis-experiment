In short to keep with game play ability length. Mass Effect 2 is a Action third person shooter first and foremost.ANYONE thinking ME2 would continue on the deep and compelling Universe and story lines set up in Mass effect will be greatly disappointed. Even the save game transfers from ME are mostly meaningless as all the carry over choices (with exception of 1 but ill not ruin that here) are minimalized and finished off with NO future adventure or interaction (beyond a short conversation here and there). In short the Open World Storyline design of Mass Effect is removed and replaced with a singular Linear Third Person Shooter design. now none of that is terrible (well other then short length of game, thats unforgivable), if thats what you went in expecting. Sadly EA marketted this game as the spiritual and RPG expansion of the first to up box sales at release. Typical EA. Mass Effect 2 is a Sci Fi third person shooter. Its has semi interesting characters and you even get to decide who you romance (WOOT, from choosing if a alien speices lives or dies in ME1 to who you get a black screen with in ME2). In the end, If you like the Mass Effect Universe and like shooters, you will like this gameJust dont go into it thinking your getting the next installment of the original Mass Effect RPG. That franchise stopped production after #1
