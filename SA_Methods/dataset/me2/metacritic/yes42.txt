 Probably the best game experience I've ever had and I've been playing computer games (a lot) since Intellivision. Almost everything has been tweaked for the better and it's even more rewarding if you import your Shephard from ME1. If this is the level of perfection we are to expect from Bioware in the future I can't wait for DA2 and ME3.
