 The story really draws u in, the characters are awesome, Shepard is kick***, the missions are fun, graphics are great, cinematics are very well-done, new cerberus network for downloadable content is another plus, bringing the saved game from ME 1 is a great idea that blended fantastic into ME2's storyline, battles are much smoother, classes are streamlined(which is a good thing) and easier to manage. I can not wait to see what bioware does for ME3!
