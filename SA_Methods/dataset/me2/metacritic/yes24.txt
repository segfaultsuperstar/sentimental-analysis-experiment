 I gave Mass Effect 2 10 points for a reason. The first piece of the series was very good as well but it also had many-many flaws. (boring fights, space buggy, and e.g. infiltrator class was merely useless as sniper.) But it seems that Bioware learned from these mistakes, they've listened to reviews and polished the flaws into a perfect gem. Before I played I've heard that the RP part of the game is really dull. It is not. I am a great western RPG fan and I found ME2 a wonderful RPG. Why? You have a good reason for both being a Paragon or a Renegade. In many other RPGs evil characters are just slimy bastards, skinning a sad puppy alive just because for one reason: they are eeeeevul. Veeeeery eeeevul. In ME2 you are not purely evil (if that is your choice) but you are a ruthless killing machine with only one goal: complete the mission at any costs. If Dirty Harry was evil, then yes, Renegade is evil. Some might say that there are way too many cutscenes. But you also have to recognize that today games are not like as they used to be. ME2 is a complex masterpiece of an action RPG and a exciting space action movie with a very wellbuilt universe. (I am not a big fan of sci-fi but this world got me.) The best improve was mining tho. It is still better to scan a planet with a mouse than navigating a vehicle that acts like a one-legged blind dog that has rabies. And in ME2 you can actually make use of the minerals. I enjoyed gathering them for the upgrades. So I could craft my very own variety of heavy weapons. The only reason why I WOULD give it a 9, are the DLCs. I hate greedy companies and Bioware became one. It's okay to have more missions for money. But better gear for money... that is lame. And the additional hencheman "quest" is also very lame and pointless. But since I am talking about the game called Mass Effect 2 and not the DLCs, I give it a 10. I am looking forward for part 3. p.s. Okay, the terminator endboss was gay, but we all like huge robots.
