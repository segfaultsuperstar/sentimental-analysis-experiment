 First off, the Story is both Epic and amazing, one of the best stories I've seen in a Video Game and books that I have read. I would go on and babble about every last thing I loved about Mass Effect 2 but that would take weeks to do and is easier to simply say that the entire thing amazing and I loved it all. But due to the fact this game is made by Bioware no one should really be surprised since amazing story lines are the trademark of most if not all Bioware games. Mass Effect 2 improved upon the game elements that were lacking in Mass Effect and either removed them or Improved them; such as the equipment Management that was a real pain in my opinion. I honestly cannot think of a single thing that I can complain about that is apart of the game. The thing I will complain about is that my laptop doesn't support the PC version which is more my fault for buying a crappy laptop rather then it being Bioware's fault. If you haven't played this game you should, if you have and didn't like it something's wrong with you.
