 The best game ive ever played, amazing story, fantastic graphics, fasinating characters and locations, truly epic score, fast and intense combat, i could go on and on what makes this game great. The only dissapointment for me was the removel of the RPG elements from the first game, Inventory managment, not nearly as much skills in the first game, four upgrades per body region ( head, torso, legs, arms, shoulders, ) i expected tons and tons of loot like the first game but we cant have everything, only 3 guns (aside from heavy weapons which has five) per weapon class. but these things can be overlooked easily.
