 Very well made, engrossing game that will easily eat up hundreds of hours of your life because of its incredible re-playability if you let it. The quality and presentation of the story is top of the line, and the game play is smooth and action-packed. If you are looking for a more traditional RPG where a large portion of your game time is spent sifting through piles of loot and armor looking to mini-max all your characters, then this game is not for you, because it is an ACTION RPG, with heavy emphasis on the action in this case. (Just like all bioware games, I might add). The game plays well, and is very challenging and requires a tactical approach if you are willing to play it on the highest difficulty settings. Also, why does Metacritic count the ratings of people who haven't even played the game all the way through? This game deserves a user score higher than 8.8.
