 It's not bad. It ain't an RPG though, and that's what's bummed me out more than anything. 3rd person shooter with a few choices of weapon. If this game had called itself a 3rd person shooter i'd have given it 6 - maybe 7. but I felt cheated cause it called itself an RPG, and it just aint an RPG at all. If even bioware don't do rpg's anymore, and now FFxiii turns out to be another on rails shooter. well there just ain't no single player rpg's left is there.
