My review for this one is similar to the first.  Gameplay: Walk slowly down hallways, aim slowly at bad guys, press a button to take cover as they slowly walk and aim at you. Like every other console third person shooter, only especially slow. The story; you are a space marine fighting an alien force bent on destroying life. Sound familiar? It should, and I shouldn't have to list the HUNDREDS of examples. The definition of average. The one thing this game has over similar titles is the speech options and customizations that allow you to feel like your game is special. It's not, but at least they pull off the ability to make you feel it is.  Mass effect 2 has one issue in particular that I feel should be discussed.  Many of the things you attempt are oddly limited, despite the games hinting towards your ability to accomplish such things.  For example, the second time I played the game, I played as fem shep, just so I could totally lez out (Im a typical 20 something bro).  The game seemed like it would allow you to do whatever (or whomever) I wished, but then at the end, denied.  So I just figured girl on girl action just wasn't in the game...until I found out later that is was, only with specific characters.  One of those characters is NOT the girl who says shes slept with women before!  Say what you will about gay stuff, but that's just bad game design.  A good game will either flat out tell you something is impossible (fable will show you if a character digs chicks before you even talk to them) or never present you with an option to waste your time (halflife has no romance).  A bad game design will let the player waste his time doing something it hints towards being possible, only to punish them later.  We play games to get away from that crap.  Many aspects of this games choose your own adventure style play are bad game design, even more so than the first.
