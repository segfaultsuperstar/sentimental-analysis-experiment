 An utterly amazing experience. The incredible opening, the experience of meeting your first new crew member, the combat, the 'blade runner' esque settings. Almost a work of gaming art. It's such a shame there are idiots on here giving this game a zero score. Idiots. I mean, seriously. Really zero??
