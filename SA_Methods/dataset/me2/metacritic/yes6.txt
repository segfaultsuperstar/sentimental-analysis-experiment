 Overall Impression: Absolutely Awesome. Most of the big-picture criticism I've been hearing about this game regards it as an RPG, a shooter, or both. But really, describing it as these genres just misses something big: at its heart, it's a *dynamic story* game. It's all about the characters and the plot. The shooting is fun, and adds that crucial element of skill that most gamers need, but it's still nothing I'd quite call a real 'shooter'. Likewise, having control over your face, armor, class and powers adds customization in the sense of an RPG, but player-character development isn't what I'd say is the main focus, and true star, of the game, and you're not just following a rigid character along witnessing his story, either. The greatest aspect of the game is the story - not just the content and succession of events, but the incredible potential that the player has to mold the game around his choices of dialog and action. The characters are deep and enthralling, and the story content itself is very cool, but the thing that makes me want to play Mass Effect 2 over and over - what makes the game so uniquely engaging - is how dynamic it is: how involving and rewarding the player's role in the story feels, and the insane degree of flexibility written into what can happen in a relatively fixed and linear world. Sure it has its flaws: little things like graphics bugs (though these were rare), and frustrating flaws in cover mechanics, and class balance (mainly for Insanity difficulty), and, of course, the super-boring-not-interesting-or-innovative-at-all mining 'activity' (chore), but none of the game's downsides were great enough to take away from that epic and satisfying feeling you get once you're done.
