It is so far away from the feeling of Mass Effect, that we can call it a Reboot. It is not a dungeon crawling RPG anymore. The inventory management was "streamlined" to oblivion. Same goes to the stats. The maps still look nice but they are absolutely linear, COD style.The designers even removed the map function altogether in case of combat maps. If you hit M, a compass will point to a direction and that is it. The combat system was changed for the worse. I absolutely hate the ammo system. The overheat system of Mass Effect 1 was way better to control the damage output. I run out of ammo from the primary and secondary weapons frequently because the enemies seldom drop anything. The story is smaller, less interesting and somewhat forced. It doesn't feel too connected to the events in Mass Effect 1. Some background stories of the characters were nice, but the character development doesn't really fit a 2nd part. Mass Effect 2 story would have worked a whole lot better as Mass Effect 1. Then the story of Mass Effect 1 would follow. The ending is very weak compared to ME1. You spend 60+ hours to build up the team for the heist. And then, it is over in 45 mins. Whaat? And the last enemy is just silly. I can't find a better word for it. If it was ME1, then it would be OK. However, after ME1 ending, it pales in comparision. The replay value is still low. I know I will not force myself through the storyline as a renegade just to see some slightly different plotlines. The game is just too long to redo it for 10-20% difference in the outcome. The interface is worse than in ME1. The planetary exploration interface slightly more useful. However I would rather have a mix of ME1 rover maps and ME2 scanner minigame then just this or just that. All in all, I don't know what the idea was with ME2, but it doesn't do service or add improvement to the fans of ME1 on any level.
