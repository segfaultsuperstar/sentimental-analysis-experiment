A dumbed down Mass Effect 2. Corridor shooter, so few RPG elements that it's actually FPS more than RPG. A teen game with lame dialogue and occasional flirting wtih sex. Main story game is decent, graphics great for the time. Overall skip if you're looking for an RPG/grownup game, play if you don't like thinking and are just looking for shooting/running/following an objective marker.
