 This game is brilliant, even if you choose to look past the amazing graphics, the revamped gameplay and the voice acting there is still the numerous amount of side quests and subplots to get drown into. This is a testament to the amount of depth to be experienced even after completing it. This game is a must for sci fi and 3rd person shooter fans alike .
