 Great work from Bioware, once again. It's fun, challenging (on insanity), and makes you wish there was more. While it's not innovative in the least, could use a graphical tune up (at least from a PC user's perspective), and doesn't really move Mass Effect's story very far along, it's a great RPG/FPS shooter that is worth full price, you'll get at least 2 plays out of this (for about 50-60~ hours total), if not more.
