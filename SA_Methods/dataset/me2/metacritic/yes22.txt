 Mass effect introduces a new generation of RPG finally free from all the constraints of D&D from the eighties! No stats, no inventory but a awesome universe in wich YOU are the hero. All you actions have real consequences, THIS is role playing. The characters, the story, but above all, the universe are incredibly well written. With also a very good realization ME2 is one the most fascinating games ever created. I go back among the stars :) ... Thx Bioware!
