 Quite possibly one of the greatest games of modern times. We are seeing the future of gaming with ME2, in depth decision making in the progression of th game. Far more developed than the game-play in ME1, which was good, but this is just better in everyway. Graphics are incredibly eye-pleasing and cinematics suggest this is one of those few games that deserves to be put up on the big screen, something which is already being discussed. I look forward the the 3 and final installment of the series and hope they improve on this yet again.
