 Practically perfect. My actual score would be something like 9.5 because there are a few minor bugs and some elements could be refined a little. But the game is awesome. Surpasses ME1 in almost every area. More team members, better and wittier interactions (Talk to Joker, you'll know what I mean). All in all, you will not regret buying this game. Just look at the scores. I'm not the only one praising the game.
