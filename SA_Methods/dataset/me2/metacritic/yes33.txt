 Mass Effect 1 is now the 2nd best game ever. No game managed to connect with my emotions like ME1 and now ME2 did. It's not about graphics, gameplay, stats or other technical aspects. It's about emotion, it's about experience. I don't care if it's an RPG, an action game, a chicken or whatever. It's just a masterpiece.
