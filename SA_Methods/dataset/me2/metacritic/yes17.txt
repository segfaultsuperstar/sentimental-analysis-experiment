 Beautifull cinematic game that builds right through the game. It was refreshing to see a game that had a feeling for timing and heightened the tension at the right moments while questioning your ethical views of the detailed alien universe around you, endless possibilities, and endless fun. This is one of the few games I have ever finished without losing interest, there was only about 20 minutes during this game where I became a bit bored with dealing with the crews problems. Recommended to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi or RPGs, the shooter element is a backseat on tradition.
