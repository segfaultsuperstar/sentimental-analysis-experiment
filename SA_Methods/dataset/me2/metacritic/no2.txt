 I have been finding more and more of the same thing in this new overrated games, repetition. The weapons are awfully generic. The missions either involve hours of duck and cover clunky repetitive movements or convincing some person to do something through 20 different conversations. Mineral scanning was cool at first but after the first planet of just using some fancy tool to find high readings of minerals, it just gets annoying. The game is incredibly one dimensional; either you talk or you do missions. Some of the missions are so pointless I thought it was a joke. Hacking objects took little to no effort and I found myself getting the newest upgrades in no time. The story line was a little interesting in my opinion but as an overall "epic" quest line I was not impressed at all. The level design is so poor that it looks that they used the same boring silver color on every material. The cities and towns I discovered were so bland it was annoying to look at. The environments had so much potential but was sadly a huge disappointment. You find laptops and things here and there to get credits which did not feel like a challenge at all. These objects that gave you goodies like money and upgrades were practically shown to you like a baby. There was no challenge what so ever during the combat. The bosses were all so easy that I thought they were just some mini boss. The RPG elements have very little depth. Every decision made a difference which was, in my mind, was the coolest part about the game. There is a type of karma system; paragon meaning sympathizer and renegade meaning bad ass basically. The system was a little interesting giving you options later based on your level of either paragon or renegade. The game does have skills or "biotic powers" which aid you in combat. The game overall was half of my expectations landing a 5 at best. I would not recommend this game to anyone except the fans of repetitive, one dimensional, clunky, and overrated games
