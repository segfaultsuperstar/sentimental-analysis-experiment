 This is frankly one of the best game I have ever played on my PC. It is the best rpg-shooter, period. It improves upon its predecessor in every way. Weapons handling : Aiming is better. New weapons aka heavy weapons such as the Cain nuke launcher or missile launcher are great additions. No more stupid inventory handling (constantly checking weapon/gear stats, and selling the crappy ones to the vendors or turning them to omnigel, very boring IMO). Tactics have been streamlined to just two commands (from the previous 4) : hold position using the 'Q' and 'E' keys, and regroup using the 'C' key, much much better. NPC conversations/dialogues are more vibrant and interesting (did they hire a better writer?), story was also more intriguing. No stupid Mako driving on the planet (which never made any sense anyway, not with the current technological level), just scan a planet while you're at orbit and send a probe if you find anything interesting. Brilliant! Bottom-line : where the previous game had a lot of hassles and redundancies, this game has none. Oh and the graphics have also improved, especially the textures which look much more crisp. Excellent game. Can't wait for the third installment. For those who have never played ME1 but would like to after playing ME2, a word of warning, you will be sorely dissapointed, like I said ME2 is a huge improvement upon its predecessor.
