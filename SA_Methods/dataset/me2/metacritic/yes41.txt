 What else i can say about this game ? This is a really RPG , maybe we are all want more character skills , loots ,exp , but RPG means Role Playing Character , and in Mass Effect 2 this part is at 200% , your actions affect the world , the NPCs , everything . Mass Effect 2 brings a new definition of role playing games . Thanks Bioware for another gold product so soon (dragon age origins was the first )
