 Wondering if some of these critics actually play the game or just bash to help their commitments to other upcomming developments. This game is the top of its kind, and there are no bugs worth giving this less than a 96 in metascore or a 10 user only rating for gameplay. META remove critics paid or giving this game anything below a 90, they have not touched the game to rate so low. Reputable critics not less than 98, so go figure.
