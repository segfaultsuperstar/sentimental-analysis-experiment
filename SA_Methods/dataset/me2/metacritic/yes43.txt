 I would actually give this game a 9.5 or 9.6. It's near perfect; nearly all of the annoyances from Mass Effect have been corrected. The only weaknesses are a lack of armor options, too few side missions, and not enough in-game money. The game is pleasantly long, good graphics, great story, good voice acting, etc. I'm usually unable to play a game through twice in a row without getting bored, but I did with ME2 and still want more.
