 This game is overall impressive leaving me in awe at almost every decision I made. people will temper with the fact that it doesn't show 100% rpg elements but the story feeds the addiction to want to play more pulling you in as commander Shepard i was far more than impressed by the story and way it reflects on the end I didn't find any need to repeat actions i recommend playing on insanity to really dive you in to some intense game play making your actions reflect that much more on the outcome.
