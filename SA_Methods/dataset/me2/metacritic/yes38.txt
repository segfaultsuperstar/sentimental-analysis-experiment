 Initially, I was surprised at the lack of rpg elements from this game (after playing Fallout 3 for a while,) however this game in a whole other genre. Mass Effect 2 falls into a new breed of games descending from the action and rpg genre, named the action-rpg. There are many decisions you must make in the game that will have consequences in the future and even in future games. Choice made in the first Mass Effect also carry out into this game very effectively. The graphics are a visual achievement and some of the best I have seen in a video game. I have noticed very few glitches that will be patched (sometimes it is possible to fall out the map.) The initial dlc is also great and free. Environments are even more immersive than the first game, and its nice to see old familiar areas return. Voice acting is nothing short of specular. There are many areas to explore, and so far I have played over 60 hours and have not even finished the game, and do not see the end. Also, after playing the pc version extensively, I have found nothing that even says this is a console port (although I have yet to see the 360 version.) What some people don't understand is this is not a really a rpg. It's something entirely new. Other game developers should take note, as this is how games should be made.
