This game obviously has the taint of a product acquired by and developed under EA. It seems undercut, uninspired and super linear and super short. Mass Effect 1 was really a great game and this was deprived of all the things that made ME1 fantastic:* Great story* Unlimited Ammo* Large selection of stuff to buy* Really cool ATV* Tons of side quests that kept the game interestingThe only things that really give merit to ME2 is:* Customizable equipment* Weapon ProficiencyIf you want to swim in ME1 nostalgia go ahead and buy this game, it seems to have the aesthetic theme. But you will be upset with the result. This game is almost as boring as Dragon Age: Origins, at least I get to move around and shoot things. Adds some interest...
