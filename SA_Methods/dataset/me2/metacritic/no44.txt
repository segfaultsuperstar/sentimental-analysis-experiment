This very loosely an rpg, it's more of an fps action/rpg. The game itself has very few flaw, but most glaring one are your so called team mates which you have to keep a close eye on and near you, because your Shepard is the main target for enemies. The other glaring flaw is your view point which is behind and slightly to the right of your character, and while it works for games like swtor or skyrim it does not in fps. Skyrim has the best pov in a game since you can choose your pov. It would been better if this was a true fps.
