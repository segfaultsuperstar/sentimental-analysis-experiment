 By far the best game I've ever played. The story is brilliant, the decisions you can make can be extremely difficult, amazing character skill trees, phenomenal voice acting, stunning graphics, incredibly fun gameplay, this game has it all. And in addition, there are virtually no bugs or glitches, saves are instantaneous, and the characters are extremely interesting. The research system is brilliant as well, however I would complain about how the consistent need to gather minerals via scanning can get tedious after awhile. Also, though the side missions are more in depth than in ME1, they still seem to fall short of the rest of the game and seem more as added content to try and appease players rather than missions that were actually well-developed (not to mention there are a very small number of sidequests for an RPG of this scale). All in all, this game has everything any RPG or sci-fi lover could ever hope for in a game. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is a fan of either of the aforementioned genres.
