 This is a gem which will catch and hold you for its entire 25 to 30 hour duration. It's definitely not a traditional roleplaying game; there are no stats to track other than how far you advance a limited set of abilities for your character, based on class. However, the dialog options and sheer number of choices you can make are second to none. You can play through the story in vastly different ways, and each path is compelling and wonderful. A lot of people will say that this is more of a shooter and less of an RPG, but I maintain that at least in the character choices (and the fact that there are many, many roles to play) this is a true RPG to its core. You don't do this kind of decision making in Call of Duty.
