												DO NOT BUY!Game will play but you will not be able to save at all thanks to Games for Windows Live which will not accept the product key given. There are alot of people with this problem so don't become one of them. This problem occurs with both GTA IV and GTA IV EFLC. I'll probably go back to San Andreas and Vice City which of course works.
