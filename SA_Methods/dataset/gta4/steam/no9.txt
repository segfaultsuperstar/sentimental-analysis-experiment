												Useless in 2016. Getting Rockstar Social Club to work isn't possible for me, even though I can log in on the website. Windows Live Marketplace is also trash and can't log in while I'm in game. When I go in offline mode I can't even turn up the graphics above 800x600. Not worth buying at all anymore.I remember somehow getting things to work a couple of years back, but not anymore. Everyone who tries to come up with their own 'game marketplace' for PC ends up ruining things.
