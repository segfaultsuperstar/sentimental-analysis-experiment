												I'm trying for the third ruddy time to get through GTA4. Every time I reinstall my OS, I need to restart the game. This time however, I modded in the Countach over a semi-common car, making it more fun to travel, and go from orange, to yellow, to red, etc Countaches as they get wrecked in quick succession. I can't wait to get through it so I can do the following games. If you like open world style games, this is worth looking at. The fact there there are tons of possible mods is just a huge plus.
