												tl;dr - Buy it for a consoleDue to the use of Games For Windows Live and SecuROM, this game (and Episodes from LC) is not playable out of the box anymore (especially on Windows 10). Some people defend this because the game is "old", but GFWL (which is DRM) and SecuROM DRM were objectively bad ideas back then too, especially for a Steam release of a game (which is already DRM).
