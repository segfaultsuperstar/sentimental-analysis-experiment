												I tried this game a while back on a Quad Core Intel with a Radeon HD 5570.  Lagtastic!  Meanwhile Saints Row The Third, ran just fine, on the same Hardware.  Does Rockstar not care about the PC anymore?  This game seems to say so.  Four seperate DRMs (Games for Windows Live, Rockstar Social Club, SecuROM and Steam).  The storyline is decent, if the game wasn't horrible in terms of performance.  And, no Roman, I don't want to go bowling!  If you have a powerful gaming PC, then it may work fine but I would rather just have fun playing older GTA games or Saints Row.
