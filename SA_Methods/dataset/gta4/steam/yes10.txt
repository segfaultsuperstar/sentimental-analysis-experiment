												This was the first Grand Theft Auto game i had ever played and i enjoyed it immensely. Although some people criticise its story for being dreary, i still found it intiresting and played through the game in its entirety. Liberty City is a well detailed city (although has little to no other scenery) despite the low textures and somewhat washed out lighting the game still holds up graphically 6 years from release. I enjoyed the more realistic handling as i drove around the city completing missions and enjoying the scenery. the shooting and cover mechanics are all well implemented and fun to use. Humour in the game is good but sometimes rare. The game is slightly bare in terms of features (minimal character customisation, few enterable buildings) but the features it does include are very well done.The multiplayer is unbelievably fun with friends and the singleplayer is fun too. definitely recommended.
