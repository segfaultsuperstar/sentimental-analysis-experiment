												The game was working pefectly after I downloaded Windows Live. Worked for a few days, then I went on a trip for two weeks. Once I came back, the game doesn't run anymore. I have no idea why. ♥♥♥♥ing Rockstar.Update: After the current update, the game runs better than ever. I just wish the update was dished out sooner.
