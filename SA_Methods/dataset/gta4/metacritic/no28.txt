Man I've went through hell and back trying to run this game on various PC models of mines. I upgraded from a GT 640 to a GTX 750Ti and that's probably the only reason I can run the game smoothly. The annoying patches and save deletes I have went through as well as launch issues overtime and just GOD AWFUL optimization where regardless of what rig you have everything cannot be ran at ultra high because then just a crap load of other sh*t will happen. Just like 5 that released without mods It would be a weaker score and try buying this game today and man you will have trouble even being able to launch the game.
