The best AAA game ever.  Rockstar North had amazingly high hopes for this game and pulled it off.  Is the story worthy of literary awards?  No, but as far as videogame stories go, it is friggin Shakespeare.  They actually get you care about the  characters, and you really want to know how things turn out.  The driving is first rate, smooth and fun, but still requiring skill.  It's great fun to master the mechanics, and then proceed to drive fast and furious.  The combat, a little clunky, but it is a minor flaw in what otherwise is the best game of this generation.
