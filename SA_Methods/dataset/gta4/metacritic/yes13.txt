 It is a beautiful game, the city is alive, you can interact with anyone and anything, the graphics and physics are mind-blowing, and the juice of the game is the gameplay, dialogues, radio and tv talk-shows. I can't stop laughing , satire all the way...perfect. If only it would perform better on the PC platform...but with a GTX260/280 and a Quad core CPU ypu will be able to play the game above 25 fps.
