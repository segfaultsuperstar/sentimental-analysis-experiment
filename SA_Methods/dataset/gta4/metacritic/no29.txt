I still remember how badly optimised this game is on Windows. I was having the top hardware at the time of release but I couldn't get over 30fps. Game is also loaded with bugs. Story is far too dark and there is a lot less content than GTASA. IMO, trying to be realistic is a huge mistake of the GTA franchise - it killed the charm and humour present in the GTA3 era releases.
