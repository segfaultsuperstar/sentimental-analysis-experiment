Most dissapointing game ever ! This game was supposed to  be designed for super computers or mainframes, not PC ! My PC has dual 8800 ultra, quad 6600, 8 GB RAM and it is still not good enough for this game. This game did not offer SLI. This means I do not have any advantage in comparision with using single video card. With only 1 8800 ultra, I tried to set graphic to High and tried to play. The screen did not move ! I quit and then set the graphic to Medium. Frame rate was better, about 3 frames per second ! This is not a joke ! Finally I set to Low. Then i could play. However, it worked just for a while. Frame rate began to be unstable, the screen began to shake.. Finally I deleted this game! Waste of time ! Waste of money ! With this insane hardware requirement and poor performance, how many people who have PC powerful enough to play this PC version ?
