I went with the crowd of gta fans and got this expansion it's o.k but the story is just boring. Your old boss leaves prison only to go insane try and kill you and you get back in a prison riot. Woohoo!    The way that they tied all this in with Grand theft auto and the ballad of gay tony is very clever and the bank heist is ad prison break are exciting missions but most of the game bored me.   First it's shortness bugged me, two days I was done with a total of 8 hours. then characters are boring and don't do much. If this was it's own game it wouldn't be bad but it's part of gta and the massive development of long term characters like Roman,Jacob, and Packie got, then here it's like "hi I'm here but in 5 minuets I'll be dead so who cares."   the taking cover shooting and fighting were all great and that's why i even gave this a 5/10. If i have to rate it the story is ok but right after i beat gta4 and it's epic story this tie in seems like it should have just been a side mission so i give 3/10 for story. The new guns like automatic pistol bike chases and leather jackets were all cool. And it's hard to ruin the fighting after its so great in the game so 6/10 for action. And the worst part was the cellphone every you get a txt you struggle to read it but it's near impossible.   In my opinion this is here just for convenience for the gta4 and BoGT and cut scene prove me right. they attack Tony which leads to Niko attacked which leads between the two and so on.   The only positive thing I have to say is the diamond subplot is very well done and are the only missions in this game but have opinion you have yours.
