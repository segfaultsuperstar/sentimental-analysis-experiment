Worst conversion ever. What was Rockstar thinking?  The controls are awkward to say the least, the camera is terrible, both on foot and on car, and the requirements are just insane, forcing you to play it on ridiculously low and ygly settings even on good PCs.  The thing that most annoy me... why do the camera "bumps" when you turn your view? It's one of the most annoying things I've ever seen in a game control setting, and there is no way to fix it. Coupled with the awful controls and you'll find yourself incapable of running in a precise way. And mouse+keyboard should be a more precise device than the gamepad...  Has this game even been tested? I don't think so.  Rocksatar, please properly test your next games, this is one huge fail and one huge disappointment.   Don't waste your money on this crap. Maybe it's good on consoles, but on PC is simply terrible.
