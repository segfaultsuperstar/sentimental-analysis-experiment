This game is a mess, just like San Andreas & the others.In my opinion the only GTA worth playing is Vice City but don't make a passion out of it either.  In this game you play the role of Nico Bellic, a serbian that comes "to conquer America".He comes to Liberty City where his established cousin Roman Bellic lives.The game begins in the style of a blockbuster movie with Roman waiting Nico at the harbor to pick him up with his car.While traveling, they use bad language, foul language like 2 punks & then they arrive at Romans appartment & the next day Roman shows Nico his new appartment, a 2 by 2 room with a small kitchen & so the adventure begins.Liberty City, the same old city from GTA3 but this time with 95% realistic graphics & environments.GTA4 is literally an Interactive Movie, it has nothing to do with gaming.If you don't know exactly what's an Interactive Movie, just think about Super Mario Bros 1 & then compare it with this one.You will finally know how to make a difference between a true video game & a pseudo video game.  GTA4 brings nothing new to the table & it's literally a waste of time & knowledge-you have nothing good to learn from such a medium the only thing that does is to corrupt you.Stay away from it if you have a good soul otherwise this is your home.The same type of missions-go there & do that & tha-da:mission accomplished.Now go save your game...wait a sec.In order to play the game, you must first create an account on Rockstar Games Social Club & then if you want to save your progress you must create a 2nd account on Windows Live-for what?For this piece of junk?Just because it looks 95% real?Realism is not the answer in Video Games-it exactly the opposite.Fantasy is the answer.Why do we play these games exactly?To escape from the real world to evade in a totally different one that's why.& GTA4 offers me exactly what i hate the most-the modern society.I don't know man, i think there should be 2 categories here on this site:The first dedicated to Video-Games & the 2nd to Interactive Movies.I just start laughing when i hear people saying "Wow, this is one of the best games i've ever played" & i say to myself:What game?:)  Moreover, the PC version of this mess also has technical problems-it runs like hell even on High End PC's.probably only the most advanced PC's on the market would save the day.Nico controls like hell, he's a real pain in the ***.He moves around like a defect robot or something he pisses me of.Where are the smooth controls from GTA3 & Vice City?& you get busted by the police in a matter of seconds.If you punch a person in the face on the streets the cops will come & you need patience to get away.It's very realistic, that is the problem.The days when you could ran over with the car over a lot of people are long gone but that is of course a bad thing.I've played only the first 12 or 14 missions since the begining & after that i've quit.I've felt that i was really wasting my time & was more frustration than entertainment.I've been fooled by Rockstar Games for the last time-i'm not getting into their junk again.  A new small feature in the gameplay is the use of the GPS while in the car to track down your route & stuff like that i don't remember exactly.You get to meet a woman named Michelle & get to date her-that was so boring.It was like...she calls me on the phone & i go with the car to her appartment to pick her up & we go togheter to bowling & on the way we keep talking bla-bla-bla.At the bowling we stay like 20 seconds & then she says that she wants back home.I drive her back home & that's it.The next day it's something similar.The music at the radio is simply awfull, junk music.Souljaboy would have been interesting to listen too but we get something even more...oh i forgot about Bob Marley sorry, that is the only good thing on the radio.& at mission 10 i get to meet a jamaican & do all sorts of cliches with him like ran over with the car some drug dealers & go to an apartment to shoot some guys & stuff like that that i've seen for a thousand of times before i'm so sick of it.So why is this game considered so great?Simple, because it's so realistic that it scares you-it's the sole reason.  That's it, GTA4 has convinced me to stop playing this series once & for all.Maybe i'll touch again Vice City some day...some day.  Bottom Line:  GTA4=The most overrated(i don't even know how to call it) game or interactive movie whatever of all time.It brings nothing new & it's a bad example for society & mankind & it's a disgrace to life & must be banished into the depths of...yes, the graphics have corrupted me in some way, that's why i give it 5.5.
