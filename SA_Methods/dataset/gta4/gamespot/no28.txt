If i buy a game, i shouldn´t have to spend 10 hours trying to get it working and wait days for the patch (thank steam, i got my money back, but rockstar still ignores the big proplem like a bunch of greedy rebublicans).    Horrible optimization thanks to laziness of Rockstar. I´m able to play it on 800 x 600 & low with a PC that runs Crysis high / 720p. The game is very playable on the consoles, but i don´t like Rockstar whoring out an original pc-game and leaving pc-gamers with **** After supporting the idiot company for 10 years, it´s definately over now. I hope Mafia 2 will run all over this.
