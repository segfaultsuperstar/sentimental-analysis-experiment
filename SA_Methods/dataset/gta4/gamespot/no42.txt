This game... supposed to be one of the greatest games, is not playable. I don't know how many of those filthy rich people have their $3000 computers, but I don't. Even if I had $3000, I don't think I'd spend it on a computer. So, given the assumption that not so many people have such rigs, this game is a total disaster. How can I give anything higher than 1.0 when I can't even play the game? It's not the graphics is so astonishing that the computer can't handle it. It's just like GTA SA, but with extreme lagggg. The PC version of GTA SA was great, but this? Well, you know the answer. I'm kind of thinking about buying xbox 360 and be done with these pc disasters. Well, xbox 360 is only 200 bucks, and my video card itself was worth more than that. I'd suggest don't waste your money on the pc version, but for those with rigs worth 3 grand, indulge yourselves!
