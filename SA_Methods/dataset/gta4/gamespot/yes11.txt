As far as the game itself goes id give it a 9 or 10 but the game as it is is broken and combined with the blatant lies by R*, this would have to be the most abominable port of a game ever.  Anyone playing this game is sure to come across the graphics issues. The shadows flicker and are completely annoying. I'm running a dual-quad core Xeon with geforce 9800 gtx sli and 2gig ram  the game flows great, but textures are missing on certain angles and the shadows are like dark strobe Some are saying that "this is a next gen game", I call BS on this statement, how can a current console game be "next gen"?  Both of these systems stated above go way beyond the gaming power of current consoles.  Now the really fun part is this,the box also clearly shows the nvidia logo on it and yet the game is not yet optimised for nvidia sli but it currently support ATI crossfire. WTF?   The textures are very bland even with the texture setting turned up to full and the sound also needs to be turned right up.  lights! I said that I mean a lot of bugs.This game needs patch and that quickly  this game is very very port on x-360 for pc
