For the first time in my life i feel so mocked of a game. I am thinking to sue Rockstar for this travesty. This game tortures the legal owner right from the start. It has you to sign up in various useless on line services that are also bugged as hell and even if you do that the game will refuse to save unless you make some extra update of windows live that never completes. I left it all night long but nothing (in a 24Mbits line- i download games from Steam quite often so...) In the end after losing my afternoon with just trying to install this game i gave up. The game is back to it's box - i wish i hadn't lost the receipt so now i can't get it back to the shop.   I understand that Rockstar did all that to prohibit users from coping it but i don't feel i deserved this torture. My only blame is that i bought it legaly. If i could get back in time i would get the pirate copy that has no need to eat all this crap. In fact i plan to aquire a pirate copy in the future so that i can actually play the game.    Lesson learnt Rockstar. From now and on i will aquire only pirated versions of any future Rockstar game. I only wish i meet some of the guys who made this crap so  i can smash his head in the wall.
