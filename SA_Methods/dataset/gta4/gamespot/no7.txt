Grand Theft Auto IV is the most overhyped and well, overrated game I have ever played.    I practically grew up playing Grand Theft Auto III back in '01 which was a fantastic game that changed the way we played our games. It brought us the open world scheme that will like to define as Sandbox. Players didn't follow a strict linear path, instead they were given an open city; a sandbox to play in. Through out the years we got Vice City, which greatly improved on the game, giving it an '80s refreshment.   And then Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the ultimate GTA game came around. The game that let you do whatever you wanted. The missions were great and varied, you got rob houses, work out in the gym, eat food, get fat, lose weight, gain muscle, play basketball and you had an RPG-esque leveling up system that could increase your accuracy, stamina, health and sex appeal.   And then there's Grand Theft Auto IV. The game we waited 4 years for. it was supposed to do everything San Andreas did and more... Only better.   However the Multiplayer was rubbish laggy mess and was not fun at all. I spent 3 hours just waiting around in lobbies not even getting a chance to play and as soon as I finally get to play, its choopy and unplayable! Days later I was able to play properly and my god, it was so boring.   The story is rubbish, and there is nothing to do in the game. No pool, unlike San Andreas, no skills, unlike SA, none of the dozens of mini games that you had back in S.A. etc. Strongly recommend that you stay away from this game. Could not stand more than 3 hours of it.
