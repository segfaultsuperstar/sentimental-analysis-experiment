The game puts you in a world where you can become part of a criminal organization... Just what I always wanted!  It could have been so much more, but games like this (forgive me programmers who did a great job) could have been much better (how did it get a 10, does Rockstar games own this website?) nothing like Nepotism... Anyway, it was entertaining but just killing for fun is not my bag. I am sure there are people who really enjoyed this game (from inside prison), but I just was not one of them. Hats off to Rockstar on making a thorough game experience, I played it for a long time, but, It could not keep me interested. I still cannot believe it got a 10... who voted for this game, an expert panel, a Washington D.C. based Think Tank? Or was it a couple of stoners who had one too many doses of various  hallucinogenic inducing compounds? While I ramble and rant about my personal feelings for the game, I am not an expert panel or a part of a Think Tank with a personal or political agenda, I am not even a stoner... I just enjoy playing games worthy of my time and effort which reward me in my small world...
