Let`s be honest here. The people who voted this game perfect 10s and 9s either haven`t played it themselves, or only played it on a console.  It`s fun, addicting, immersive and all those things. But GOOD GOD, it hasn`t optimised at all. They either completely ignored what`s under the "hood" (PCs don`t use resources the same way PCs do) or their testers are goddamn idiots.  Period.   All I wanna know is, what the hell were they thinking when they released this shoddy port?   Even on the lowest bloody settings, on the lowest bloody resolution, this game runs like poo even on the most powerful PCs.   Ridiculous, that`s all I can say.  Seriously, even a PC with the power of 3 PS3s and 3 360s couldn`t run this game proper on the lowest settings possible.   Rushed job to "please" the PC crowd and get some more money out of our pockets, that`s all it is.
