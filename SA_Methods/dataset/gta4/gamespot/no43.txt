I bought GTA with high expectations but my computer which plays Far Cry 2 in highest setting couldn't handle GTA in high resolution and textures. The installation took a long time and installed Rockstar Social Network. WTF? Games companies should stop bloating their games with such useless add on programs that do nothing special. But the worst thing of all is the car handling. What the developers were thinking when they put such stupid controls. You press break and after 1 minute the car stops. And don't try to press handbreak because the car seems to slide like it is ice skating. This game had potential but it doesn't live up too the expectations I had. I reviewed this game with 1 because it is just plain disappointing. The graphics are good but not stunning.  It is clear that Rocstar just rushed the game to be out before Christmas so the can sell more.
