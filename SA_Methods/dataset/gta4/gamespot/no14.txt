Bought it because I believed the hype, and this is what I found: Very poor graphics, pointless storyline. Jerky camera angle. Terrible gameplay.   The game has no reasonable justification. I play a lot of games. This one is a poor excuse for an XBox 360 game. The only people I've come across who like it are very immature 13 year-olds who giggle at the pointless things you can do in it.    Avoid, avoid, avoid, especially if you like an interesting storyline, fluid and challenging gameplay, or beautiful graphics. This game has none of these. I cannot understand the gamespot rating. The graphics look like old xbox graphics, there is no storyline other than 'poor immigrant trying to make a living' (?!) and the gameplay is slow and jerky.   Some people enthuse about the voice acting and the dark vision of America. Seen it and heard it before. Nothing new. Like a poor attempt at recreating a Scorcese film or a Bill Hicks stand-up routine. This game is very, very, very poor.
