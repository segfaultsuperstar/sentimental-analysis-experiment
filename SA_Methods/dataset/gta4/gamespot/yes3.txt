We encourage you to write your review in a word processor or text editor, save it to your local disk, then copy and paste it into the posting box below. Be sure to use the spell checker in the word processor.  Reviews should focus on the content and not the game it is for. Writing about other critic scores should be posted in your personal blog. Remain on topic about the piece of content.  If you have not played or used the specific piece of content, do not post a review about it. You are encouraged to post a personal blog about your opinions about it if you haven't used it.  Back up your opinions with facts. Otherwise, your review will be flagged for trolling. Merely stating "this map pack sucks" or "this horse armor is the best" is not enough.
