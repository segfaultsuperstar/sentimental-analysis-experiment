As we all know the Grand Theft Auto title has some history... a history of failure, of outrageous requirements, and countless bugs, while not having a diverse collection of vehicles, like Mercenaries 2, which can be picked up for like 5 bucks, and the only thing that gta is better than M2 is the handling... but whatever man, this is a GTA4 review after all. But even the gameplay can cause epic dissatisfaction. (ie: cars have too much grip when you dont need it, and havent got enough when you do need it) The story is about a Serbian guy who was a soldier, who's name is Niko Bellic. Now, before someone thinks im quite unintelligent to call a russian a serbian, let me tell you: All he talks about is war, and his commanders' war crimes. (There were wars in Yugoslavia, aka Croatia, Serbia and a third country I seem to forget all the time.) Anyway, how epically failing graphics can require such hardware, that might pack a punch, but still cant run gta4 is beyond any means... Also, now that (unlike San Andreas and Vice City, that has privately developed multiplayer system) Rockstar has developed a multiplayer system for this game, that seems to look like CoD6's, which of course is not the problem, playing gta online seems to become less popular, as the client fails, you cant host a server where you designate who's admin, and use your diy gamemodes and adminscripts, but simply CellphoneMultiplayerHostChoose GamemodeRun and keeping yourself annoyed by cheaters whom you cant ban, just kick, and let them enter again 3 seconds later... But what the hell? San Andreas needed time too, to earn my respect, and its possible that GTA 4 needs to do so too..   Thank you for reading this review, and have fun out there :)
