I don't know where to begin cuz i have never criticized a gta game before because i enjoyed all the previous titles that i played.I ended Vice city 6 times and San Andreas 8+ timesI'm a "real gamer" so obviously I had problems with this game.unlike other reviewers I'm not going to whine about all those glitches, cuz all games has those and they shouldn't stop you from playing a game.What i didn't liked was the shallow story line.A guy coming to US to earn cash and bad stuff happens to him and his loved ones; this is the only plot from start to finish.and who kills the main characters at the end of the game? in both endings a character die and then you cant even meet the other one. I hated loosing the first girlfriend but murder of second one was just mean.Its like piling up more reasons why should you delete this game right after ending it cuz after ending; THE MOST fun thing you could do is explode a rocket launcher or a grenade under your feet.So lets write down the good and the bad stuff shall we?Good:1) Graphics (glitches and recourse inefficiency ignored)your car breaks down more accurately then ever before but i hate the grey theme that city has adapted. Why is EVERYTHING grey(even the parks)??? New York was presented in a much better way in Driver 1 and Driver Parallel Lines2) Improved AIBad:1) Flat storyline.... thusFor this reason missions were boring and for the first time in my life i actually had to force myself to play the missions to get the game over with so i can delete this 16GB of disaster out of my PC.2) boring mission (cuz of the lame storyline)3) No check points in between long hard missions like in MAFIA4) Realistic driving (slow stopping and acceleration times take away the fun from car chases; in all the missions you are constantly looking at the map so you can calculate when to break cuz one wrong turn can end the mission and force you to start all over....I remember having a blast while driving cars in San andreas and VC but this one was just a tense experience.5) removal of classic features of GTA series that define GTA like side missions (TAXI,Police etc)6) Harder Police - No Tanks (first of all police is way too tough, even if they gave you tanks you would have never survived till the 6th star.7) Clothing: Are they kidding me 8-) i don't even have to explain myself here.8) where are our heavily liked new features??? (GYM and barber shop to make out guy more presentable, MOD garages to pimp our you sports cars and how dare they remove the Ammunition shop with the guy who sounded like hot **** on that commercial!9) Not giving us planes feels like playing GTA 3 with different story and graphics besides driving in between the island for missions was boring and tiresome; a faster way of transporting was needed.10) boring characters: i ended the game last month and I've already forgotten the names of almost all the characters.11) They make you kill helpless guys like that old man that you bust out of prison and playboy X's old partner ( how cruel do they think we are?)12) What's with all the restriction like having a live account for saving and not being able to use any controller except Microsoft's X360 for windows (my fingers started to hurt each time i played this game cuz of the award key positions)in conclusionThis gameplay felt like i was playing Driver(Lack of features) and it was trying to impersonate MAFIA(mob chasing and killing with a lot of talking) game play but failed miserably.In the race for better graphics the game has lost its edges. all the best features were removed leaving Driver to actually stand a chance in beating GTA iv (i had more fun in playing parallel lines then in GTA iv, seriously! cuz its story was much better!!!) So i recommend skipping this game even if you are bigger of a fan of this game then i am. I do wish that they ditch this new engine cuz last one was much more user friendly and insanely fun.otherwise i dont see rockstars topping San Andreas even if they put in a superb story because the features matters especially the 4th one.If i wanted realistic driving i buy Gran Turismo,we buy GTA for its hours and hours of non stop fun and that seems impossible when driving a car is a pain in the A.
