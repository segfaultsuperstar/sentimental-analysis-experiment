I was hyped and pumped for this HD version of GTA...but I have to say "Where's the beef?"  Warning: Major spoilers if you haven't played it.   Graphics: GOOD, but NOT as good as HD could be! The artwork is superb, making you feel like you are in NYC. But it's all cutouts. VERY few buildings can be entered. No basejumping!    Story: This is about the ONLY aspect of this release that keeps it from being a total loss. Good story. Kept me playing to the end.    Gameplay: Rockstar, when you make a sequel, it should have AT LEAST as much if not MORE than the previous releases. This game is on par with the very first GTA I play on PS2, only this one, the latest, has NO FLYABLE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT! And very little variety with the helicopters (I only found 2 different models). Motorcycles, well, fewer models as well. There are a few new cars and the artwork and detail on them was superb. No jetpacks, no parachuting, no countryside, no bicycles!!!!  And the final nail on the coffin, NO BUYABLE PROPERTIES AT ALL! What is the point of earning all that money? There are only so many models of guns and even fewer clothing choices than before.    Summary: GTA IV seems like an unfinished product. There are areas of the game that are just, well, empty but there are hints that there were big plans that never happened. Budget cuts? Cost overruns? Time constraints? Well, whatever happened will make me MUCH more cautious before blindly trusting and buying another GTA title ever again. The PC version was virtually unplayable. Very disappointing overall.   Look for my mint "played only once" copy available on Ebay...
