What have Rockstar done? From one of the best games of all time to an over-hyped near bore. Three years we was playing San Andreas and lovin' it. Just over a month now on IV and I really don't want to play it no more, so I'm not. Where's the fun gone???  Bad controls, bad physics/gravity, boring, repetetive missions and not much to do on the side. How has this happened?  Terrible online too. I heard the online modes weren't just tacked on, I heard wrong. The racing online is one of the most frustrating activities I have ever taken part in. No thought whatsoever has gone into the online play, it seems, but then again it is Rockstar's first real online play so, they may be forgiven. Not by me, though. With the amount of time and money spent and the amount of expectation from the fans, this game should have been much better.
