Wow. Rockstar, you amazed everyone this time.   By limiting the amount of memory (ram) the game can use to 1Gb, you have failed. Failstar. Seriously, why did you bother to release a game in this state?   I can play Crysis 2, Just Cause 2, Split Second, Prototype, Dragon Age 2 and Anno 1404 on maximum settings with enhancements via catalyst control center at 85fps+   Yet, this game fails at a snailspace of 25fps and big graphical glitches. It's not just graphical glitches, the keyboard freezes right after the introduction. This is a game you should best avoid at all costs.   I have read all over the internet that there may be a way to fix this glitch by using a no-dvd crack and circumventing the online authentication, as well as using one of many mods that supposedly may fix this game.   If you'd like to gamble with your wallet, try a casino.. or you could of course just buy this game.   Thanks for wasting my time and money.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
