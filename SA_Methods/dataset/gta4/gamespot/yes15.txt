Good Graphics, Some Good Humor but very little in it. i have not played it much, got rather bored of it. I have to say that SanAndreas came 1st, Vice City 2nd and GTA 4 came 3rd. I did not find much in it. it looked good but like they took everything from san andreas out of it. tattoos, tones of clothes, car mods, tones of guns, houses to buy, other out side missions like cops, fire fighter, ambulance, pizza, PCJ playground and the millions of packages, tags, photos, oysters, horse shoes, tones of cars, planes. also were is the army, tanks and hunter. its like what on earth, big let down. i do hope they bring it all back because many people found it a disopointment, the multiplayer was the only best thing about it. Oblivion and MGS4 is alot better than gta 4 even though MGS4 has a very short story line. If they dont bring it all back, i and many other people may say....This is the end of GTA :(
