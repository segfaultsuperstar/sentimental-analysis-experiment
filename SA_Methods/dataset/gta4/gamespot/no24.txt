8800 gts 320mb  amd 6000+ x2  2gb 667mhz ram   So i get gta4 install it all good, gotta sign up to windows live and rockstar scoial club to play... ok annoying but what the hell, its gta4, its gonna be awesome. The first thing i will say about this game is the performace is absolutely shockingly bad. i have never seen anything like this, the resident evil port was better done (maybe), i have not played the xbox 360 version but the results i got on my pc were nothing to compare with it.   I like to think that i have at least an average/decent pc for gaming, cod4, tomb raider underworld, farcry 2 i could all play on pretty much max settings (except farcry, bit lower)  at a playable fps at least. gta4 on the other hand i was forced to use something stupid like 960 x 800 just to get it to run, as you can imagine it looks very poor at this resolution, but on top of this i was getting frames of about 10 - 15 per sec.   I played for about 10 mins then promptly uninstalled the 13gb and both windows live and rockstar social club.    my advice is this, buy the console version (although i have not played these). if you still want to buy the pc version, good luck with that, but make sure that you have some sort of supercomputer, this pathetic attempt at a port is gonna take some serious hardware to run at an enjoyable sort of level. i might recommend this in a few years time when its about a tener, technology is cheaper and the games bugs and performance issues have been treated.
