This game was supposed to be new opening to the GTA series tats why its GTAIV and not GTAVI..and the expectations for this game was very high too..But it hardly keeps u glued to the game..unlike previous version like GTAVC/SA..The missions are dull jus shoot ppl around n nothing else not much variations in the missions compared to previous games..Of course der r improvements in dis game like few mini games, u have a totally customizable phone..were u can customize fro themes to ringtones etc etc, and using phone you can immediately start failed missions.. den u have in-game internet were u get some missions thro e-mails n can also find dates n check some funny websites..auto save feature is welcome n now save the game just after you complete any mission.   Downside of dis game is its heavily resource dependent..I recently upgraded my PC ,(2gb ram, 2.8Ghz,512mbNvidia geforce 8400 which is almost recommended requirement) keepin GTA IV in mind..n to my surprise I can run almost al the recent games without any prob but not GTA IV..wit minimum settings the game still lags during gun fights makin game play miserable..   Few other thing where I was disappointed was the developers failed to carry the interesting features fro previous series..like in GTASA u can customize CJ body/clothing/cars/guns, go to gym,learn fighting moves,hav your own gang ,buy properties,increase stats like improvement in shootin/running/swimming etc etc..But in GTA IV u hardly hav des features, which makes it a bit dull n less interesting..and I'm seriously wondering wats the use of al the money in dis game since u don hav to purchase anything except guns or cloths which hardly matters..   I seriously wud love to see another GTA series made based on GTASA rather than GTAIV..n al dos GTA fans if ur PC is not in range of super computer don bother abu dis game..even if u can play the game with min settings u'll hardy enjoy d view of the Liberty City..    Score:   Graphics: 9/10 (Very HIgh End PC with full settings)  Music: 10/10 (Awsome Radio)  GamePlay: 4/10 (Very less variation in missions)  Story: 8.5/10 (interesting story)  Extra Features: 0.5/10 (your money is useles n u can hardly customise Nikko)  Replay Value: 5/10 (Only cos you hav some alternate choices during missions,which can make you to replay the game jus to see the other outcome)
