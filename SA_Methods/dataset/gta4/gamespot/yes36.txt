I had high hopes for this game. The series was one of my favorites up until this atrocity. This game could've been great. They stay true to a lot of things that made them good games in this one, but the new or revised additions are very unwelcome. I didn' care much for the protagonist or the story either. Overall this game is very hard for me to get into. My main beef: MAN DATES. You will be in the middle of a hairy getaway from the cops and you're cell phone be blowing up with your cousin Roman wanting to go bowling or some bs. Then when you tell him that you are busy, he refuses to help you in any further endeavours. There is much real life simulation, that this game just makes me want to in fact go out and live it. Life in GTA is depressing and no offense but my life is way more appealing. I'll stick to dating, surfing the net, going to bars n shows, etc. for real. I didn't shell out money to simulate...badly i might add.
