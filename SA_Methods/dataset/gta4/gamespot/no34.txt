First when this game got released on pc it was very crappy... But since the nvidia drivers got released its pretty good .. Fps fix graphics improvement.. I got this game on my ps3 en pc en i gotta admit the pc version looks better but you need a powerfull computer to run it.. But maybe in the future rockstar will release a patch so that it meets his requirements .  The story is good its realistic in every way.  The multiplayer got some improvements there are more clothes to wear compared to the x360 en ps3 version so i guess that is fun 2.  Its a good game to kill your time. So all we can hope is that rockstar willl release a patch very soon that will fix the frame rate problems.  En some bugs that are included in the pc version so for now all we can do is wait..   But nuff said i gave this game  a 9.5 en not a 10 because it still is not complete for the pc but still very good.
