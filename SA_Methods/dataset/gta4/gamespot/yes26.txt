Critics somehow overlooked its glaring flaws in the control schemes and repetitive mission design for some reason. Might be the most overrated game I could think of. That's not even mentioning the annoying phone calls during shoot outs, or forced realism that bogged the game down even further. Realism has no place in actual video games, Niko constantly tripping while running got frustrating and the Devs even implented button mashing for sprint..... Why?  With a controversial Metascore of 98, I feel like im in the Twilight Zone
