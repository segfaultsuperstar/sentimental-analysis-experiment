On a rig that can run Doom 3, Crysis, Rainbow Six Vegas 2 without any problems this game (GTA) with its ugly cartoon graphics runs like a slide show. Always funny when the graphics drivers are blamed for the bad performance when others can produce much better graphics that are perfectly fluent with the same drivers. Not being able to use a Joystick and the camera spinning around endlessly sometimes is only adding even more to the unplayability of the game.   Luckily I haven't payed the bill for the game yet. This pack of garbage is going right back to the store. No money for Rockstar doublecrossers from me.
