The game is about as epic as epic can get and the positives are obvious so for this review i will only list the negatives that many seemed to have missed.   First there is too much driving and the cars sway way too much which makes turning difficult.  GTA 4 is all about realism which makes some of the less realistic things like cop AI and the endless killing more noticeable. The social aspect is cool until the dating and drinking just gets plain boring. And i dont care for nikos friends i just want to get the story over with. However, dialogue trees would add more of the gamer's touch to these parts because we wouldn't have to just watch the gathering unfold.  Dieing in the middle of a mission has you respawn at a hospital without your weapons and miles away for the mission start (more driving) that now you have to redo because there are no checkpoints.  The missions are standard fare and pretty repititious. You cycle from one boss to another and do the same thing again.  and i couldnt help but think that i was everyones **** "Sure ill risk Niko's life to get your coke back for cash that i could throw away." Cash in this game is not necessary because you dont use it for anything besides hospital bills when you die. "Why should i honestly be helping bad guys and when is this going to get personal?" is what i asked half way through.  Fast travel would have solved this problem because the annoyance of dieing and driving would have pretty much gone away. Also a save anywhere feature would have been coll because you can go postal, like you should in GTA) without worrying about getting caught and the missions would have been more enjoyable.  Combat is only good when freeaiming and the cover system is clumsy.  Thats it
