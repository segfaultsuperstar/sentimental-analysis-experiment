I'm going to start off by saying "THIS IS!" the most overrated game of all time. GTA IV is a game that is riddled with flaws and unstable game play that hinders rather than help the gaming experience. The only real thing GTA IV has over the previous GTA games is that it has state of the art graphics and mind boggling sound effects. Other than that you could scrap the whole project.   The biggest problem with GTA IV is that Rockstar obviously spent so much time on the bells and whistles but forgot to install the engine to get the bloody thing anywhere. The city lacks life, originality and personality and a bit of culture, so you're basically stuck in a city with a bunch of selfish tight asses and miserable homeless people and it seems everybody has a chip on their shoulder.   The radio stations are also pathetic as you will find only one or maybe two good songs per radio station and the commentary gets dull and repetitive very quickly. Not to mention your constantly being harassed by your cousin roman yet you can't get a call from your girlfriend???   The only good thing about GTA IV is that you can watch TV in your room and The Mens Room is a show definitely a show worth looking out for.   Overall GTA IV is an overrated piece of you know what, so if you're looking for another San Andreas or Vice City I would stay well away from GTA IV if you don't want to ruin your good GTA experiences.
