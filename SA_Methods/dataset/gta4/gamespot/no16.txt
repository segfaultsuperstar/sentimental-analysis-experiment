GTA IV has already shown its prowess on the consoles and we KNOW it is a great gam so my issue is with this port to the PC: The game itself IS stellar but you cannot give this port to the PC high marks when it displays such instability.   This smacks of some unfinished business within the halls of Rockstar.   GTA IV has all sorts of bells and whistles when it run smoothly on a PC but that is the very root of my beef.   Think back to Battlecruiser 3000AD which promised many things but after its controversial release, the game was plagued with bugs that simply did not let you experience all that was promised.   Some pointed to the work and effort put into Battlecruiser 3K BUT that means nothing if you can't get the game to work right.    It's really irresponsible for the PC version of GTA IV to get an Editor's Choice label when performance is questionable.   Moreover, the rigid contol scheme is horrid. Even with the latest patches that let me use my own non-Xbox 360 controller, I am not pleased. What happened to letting PC users map their own controls? This forces me to use my controller as if it were the Xbox 360 controller.   Truth is San Andreas allowed the PC user more freedom to control HOW you play the game. If I had wanted to play this game like I had an Xbox360, I would have BOUGHT an Xbox360.
