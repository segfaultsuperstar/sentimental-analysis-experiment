Audio: 8/10  Pretty much all the sound effects are recycled from GTA 4 but the new music and good voice acting make up for it.   Visuals: 8/10  The same GTA 4 visuals, Nothing new.   Playability: 7/10  While it features the same GTA style combat, The new motorcycle races are really disapointing and lack fun and excitement. Besides that, there is nothing really new in the form of gameplay.   Delivery: 5/10  Lost & Damned really fails to deliver a good overall experiance and is nothing compared to the game it's based on. Recycled audio and visuals definently take away from what would be a good experiance and lack of new game modes definently take an even bigger body blow. Charging 1600 MS Points (20 dollars) for this add on is a huge rip off.   Achievements: 5/10  You get nearly every achievement for beating the game but the 2 you cant get are real grinders. You gotta build 2 characters toughness to the highest point by talking to them is real annoying and Knocking off 69 riders during the races will make you really angry because the races suck to begin with.   Overall: 6/10  Lost & Damned is a recycled rip off of GTA 4 with a disapointing story with poorly crafted characters. Save your money and actually buy something you will enjoy, Skip this DLC.
