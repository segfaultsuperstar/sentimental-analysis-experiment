Man, what's wrong with the PC Ports these days. The last Good PC Port that i played was Devil May Cry 4.   Don't get me wrong, the Xbox360 and PS3 versions of GTA IV are really great and i would have given it surely a good rating. But i don't own a Console because i am a hardcore PC Gamer.   I got this game and it won't even START on my PC. So pathetic. Its an insult to the PC Gamers. Seriously you are not making some Naruto Port.   You are making a GTA port. Rockstar......don't you realize how many people including me were literally Counting Days for this game. And over that Gamespot gives this Garbage a 9.0!   Puhless....   Anyways, you need to have a REALLY REALLY Hot Rig to play this. If you don't Believe me, go to srtestDOTcom and check GTA IV.   It says Minimum Requirement : Core 2 Quad........When the HELL did a Quad Core become a Minimum Requirement for any game. Also graphics for GTA IV aren't as great as MGS 4 or Gears Of War 2 or even Prince Of Persia for that matter.   Don't Buy this game for the PC. Instead do what i am gonna do. Either get a PS3 or an Xbox360 and then BUY GTA IV. Then it will be enjoyable.   Thanks for reading my review. Now i will be back to playing One Of The Best PC Ports Of All Time - Prince Of Persia........Heck all Ubisoft PC Ports are great. Learn something Rockstar......Next time you either DON'T make a GTA for the PC or if you make one, atleast DUMB DOWN the requirements like EA did for Dead Space. Then it will be playable.
