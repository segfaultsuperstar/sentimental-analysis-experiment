Saints row is alot better then this because at least you can see further then 50 ft without it turning to complete blurr.. the multiplayer is a joke its laggy as hell.. I love gamespot but after giving this game a 10?? LMFAO your kidding me right. If this game gets a 10 then you mine as well give cod4 a 10 as well.. its way better then this. perhaps gamespot forgot to put a decimal inbetween the 1 and the 0 when they rated it. This game is seriously grand theft auto 3 with cooler cars and ragdolls.   When writing your review, remember to keep the language clean. Reviews must be 100 words minimum.
