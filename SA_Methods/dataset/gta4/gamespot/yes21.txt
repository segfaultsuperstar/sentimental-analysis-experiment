When I heard about GTAIV coming out, I thought, "Wow, maybe I can put away Call of Duty and Gears of War for a while." Well, as it turns out, Gamestop thought I was crazy when I took it back not 2 days later. While GTA has some great graphics, barely anything has changed gameplay-wise. I honestly felt like I was playing GTA3 again for a second. Multiplayer is kind of fun, and the "Cops and Robbers' type mode is interesting, but the aiming can make you miss a game-changing move,  and your team may think you are terrible. Unfortunately, GTAIV has gone the way of Halo. I can wait another few years, if Rockstar promises something fun. If you only like realistic games, this one isn't for you. The concept is something a 3-year old could understand. If you want something fun and addictive, play Crackdown. The fact is, GTAIV is an innovation, but it's same thing we played 2 years ago.
