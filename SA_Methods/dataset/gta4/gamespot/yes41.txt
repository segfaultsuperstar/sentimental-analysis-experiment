For me, story and gameplay is everything. GTA IV succeeds thoroughly when presenting a living, breathing world but manages to undercut the underlying beauty of it by populating it with a mundane story that I cannot lost myself into. The cutscenes, as always, are amazingly well-crafted (and directed) and the voicework bringing the story forward is stellar, but it is such a disappointing tale. Your missions are always the same: KILL SOMEONE, and no amount of spurious dialogue and delivery can mask the sameness of the gameplay. I wish there was an option to select Niko, and tell these mission-givers to just shut the hell up. Go solve your own problems. But that's one of the many flaws in this game.   Why is Niko in need of money? That is his stated reason every time he accepts a mission. What can he spend it on? Weapons, and that's about it. Not once do I feel an urgency to fulfill these objectives because the end result is always the same: Niko kills, gets paid, and rolls on the next mission. Only a few missions can rightly be classified as memorable and exciting (maybe): the bank robbery with the Irish brothers, and maybe the Interview aftermath. But it's all shoot and kill.   Rockstar does pull off a few nice touches in the game, but it is far too little in the overall scheme of things. First off, a lot of people have complained about Relationships/Friendships and how it is a distraction. However, I find it a little charming and adds character and believability, and made the characters more than just stock fodder. The radio stations are always a blast (though I cannot stand the talk radio stations and its general nastiness) and, I should mention this again, Liberty City itself, is an absolute beauty from the ground up. It's just so thoroughly disappointing the city cannot host a more decent story to match its awesomeness.
