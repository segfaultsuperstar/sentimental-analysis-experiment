Everyone in the industry knows rockstar are hacks. Their games are bug ridden and almost completely unoptimized. That's why other games that look 10x better run just as well or better on your system. They have the coding skills of children.   Anyways, the game is fun but really easy. It's way too easy to escape the cops. Cover is a nice feature.   The story is not bad.   Graphics are pathetic. The reviews say they're slightly weak. No, they're extremely weak. They're a joke. For the kind of system requirements this game needs the graphics are an April fools joke.   The game is laced with bugs. It runs on my system with some work, hacks and cracks, etc... The ultimate joke is that Rockstar blames hardware manufacturers for their nearly complete incompetence as if they're Jesus Christ. What narcissistic, ego centric, pathetic people.   I downloaded the game. Maybe you should use better copy protection next time rockstar.  Like why don't you make the game burn code into the flash memory of the motherboard after a reboot so the game takes 100% control of my computer. I dare you. Come on, you'd make more money. Douches.
