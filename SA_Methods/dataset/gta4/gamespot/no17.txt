i have it on Console but really wondered the difference so much that's why i checked it in my friends PC.   All i can say about this game on PC is : Tooo Bad and Tooo Weak   i am glad i am playing it on PS3. Pc version sux.soo slow also i didn't like the graphics on Pc.installation is waste of time sign up etc.Also many pc owners can not play this game easily because of system even my friend has a good system he's still having difficulties.My point is 1 because they could do the better but they didn't....   On Ps3 this game is unbeliveable it rocks.But i still can't understand why they decided to stop buying a property.it was a beautiful part of the game and i couldn't find to buy property in this game and i am dissapointed about that.Also hiring bodyguards was so good too but we can't do it anymore in this game too.These are the bad points of the game.....   As a result my point is 1.0 but it is not for GTA game it is the game on Pc version if you want to play GTA play it on Console and see the difference.....For me GTA is 9 points but on consoles not on PC
