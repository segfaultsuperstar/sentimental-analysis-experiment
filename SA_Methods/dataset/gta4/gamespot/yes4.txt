GTA IV is a fantastic open-world sandbox game by the one and only Rockstar games!    I bought this game on PC, not expecting the system requirements to be almost impossible to match.   I installed the game anyway, and it took about 3 hours. I thought it had frozen or something, but it turns out the game is 14 FREAKING GBS IN SIZE!!!   Seriously, I only had 3 MBs of hardrive space after installing this, I'm not joking.    I uninstalled some crap, and started the game only to find a SECUROM ERROR   DAMNIT!    so about 2 hours of installing No-CD cracks and patches, the game at last runs.   ...And crashes.   A LONG TIME LATER I GET IT TO WORK   And it lags. And lags. AND LAGS.   I put it on the lowest graphics settings, not a difference.    Good job Rockstar. You got a perfectly good game and ruined it with this rubbish PC port. Good job. Good job. Also, you wasted my money. Good job!   So I uninstalled it and I got pissed off and just bought the damn game for Xbox360. And I loved it! Easily one of the greatest games of the decade.   ...On CONSOLES!!!   A few months later, I wanted to install it on PC so I could install mods you can't get on Xbox360.   ERROR as soon as the installation begins.   I never got this error before. Wtf?   And it turns out THE FILES ON THE DISC ARE CORRUPTED!!!!!!!!!!   I got so pissed off I literally took the disc out of the drive and snapped it in half.   Isn't this just great? The files on the disc are corrupted. That means the disc is screwed. Forever.    Well I do reccomend this game, on consoles.    So unless you have a super massive $1,000,000 worth gaming PC, go ahead and install it.   Even if you have a super computer, probably will still slow down.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go buy a really expensive gaming computer.
