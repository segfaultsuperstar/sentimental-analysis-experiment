Thank god I didn't spend money on that game. A friend of mine got it and gave it to me to try it. First thing I noticed is that the game is on 2dvd's-the instalation took long enough and after it was done I was out 16GB from my HDD. What the hell??? Then it asks you to install some kind of Rockstarr club or something and windows live application so yuo can save your game online(if you can play it).  I am starting the game and.... laaaaaaaaaagggggg! I wouldn't be surpised if My PC was peace of sh*t but it isn't: MSI K9N Diamnod, Amd Athlon64x2 5600+ 2.8ghz, Dual channel 4GB DDR2 800mhz, Ati Radeon HD 4870 512MB GDDR5 and Vista Ultimate 64bit. On that PC the coupdn't run nice enough so I can enjoy it. I am playing Crysis on enthusiast for god's sake!  The graphicas is okay-but not as nearly as good enough for the system requirments.  I played the game for a couple of minutes-nothing really new. I really liked the way they made NY in the game.  The car driving is abysmal. Whoever created that was complete moron and had no idea how driving a car in GTAIV is.   The game has a lot of issues and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except maybe 5% of the gamers who can afford to spend $6000 on a Alienware monster PC.
