I've got a contemporary gaming PC that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of the game.  Fine. I expect to be able to run it on low settings, which I can. But on low settings the game is unplayable due to stuttering issues and other "lag" events. Further on low settings the game is really ugly.  Unacceptably ugly by my standards. The cars are fairly good but the people and the buildings and objects in the world are all dull, muddy and blurry looking.  The whole world looks like your looking through  frosted glass. Ugly and slow makes this game not worth playing. Avoid it unless you've got a machine that exceeds the recommended requirements.  On the bright side, by the time most people upgrade their machines enough to play this hog with reasonable performance it will be in the bargain bin.
