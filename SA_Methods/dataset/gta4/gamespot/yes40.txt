This game is broken, the performance is horrible and is probably worst game in terms of performance that I've purchased in the last two years.  It feels rushed, like the dev was trying to shove it out the door as fast as possible.  This is a shame because the seems to be a good game underneath all the performance issues.  My computer is pretty good:  C2D OC'd to 3.1 Ghz, 9800GX2 and 4 GB of ram and this thing runs horribly.  The recent patches help but for the most part, performance makes this game far from enjoyable.  The game doesn't support in-game AA and there is now way to force it, it looks awful!  It also has poorly implemented depth of field effect that could correct the lack of AA but it's not done correctly.  Overall, the game is killed by a lack of good performance, really low frames per second which makes playing the game a really painful experience.   EDIT JULY 17TH, 2009  Performance has improved greatly although it still runs at about 20-25 fps average, plus still no AA, but the game is far more enjoyable now.  I give the game a 6 now.
