Oooooo man, I really don't know what to say for this pathetic port. I can't describe how much I was happy when I bought this game, but after installation first problem occur, I had to install SP3, OK that was not a big problem, I downloaded SP3 from Microsoft website and start the game, and then nightmare start, the game couldn't even work under my graphic card GeForce XFX 7950GT 512MB, it was is full of bugs that I had to wait for latest driver updates. After few days nvidia 180 drivers become available I install them and even with these latest drivers the game was working so slow that even this PC specsâ€¦ AMD Athlon 3000+, 1.5GB RAM, GeForce XFX 7950GT 512/256 were not enough. Rockstar disappointed me so much that believe or not I want play any of their games anymore if they don't fix these problems with some patch. If I have chance to ask some GTA4 developers 1 question I would ask why for god sake they added this graphic card GeForce 7900 256MB for minimum requirements when not even this GeForce XFX 7950GT 512MB could run it properly.
