Imagine that you play one mission, I repeat A TRIGGERED MISSION in an open-world game for about 20 minutes, desperately fought for your life, forgetting how did you come to where you are at the first place and suddenly you die and are brought for, I repeat, 30 MINUTES earlier, 300 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE YOUR MISSION TAKES PLACE AND YOU HAVE TO D.R.I.V.E. FOR ANOTHER 15 FU**ING MINUTES TO THAT SAME PLACE, TO KILL 468 PEOPLE (AGAIN) TO APPROACH WHERE YOU WERE 1 HOUR AGO!!!!!!! So please, if anyone could tell me that's a fine relaxing time in which you have fun I would be better off to a mountain full of hungry bear-like elephants trying to rip me apart!  Mentioned gameplay takes place in a fictional setting of Grand Theft Auto 4 called Liberty City.   No spoilers here, but if you somehow manage to proceed to a very end of the game, you will be mesmerized with the, lets call it A CHECKPOINT MOMENTS at the very last mission, even dough I think that people who made this probably never heard of this gold-valued gameplay aspect. GTA 4 does not have a BAD INFLUENCE over YOUNGSTERS these days because of its content or story, but because of RAGE TRIGERING GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS! No, really, when you consider time spent in one mission which is result of RETARDED game engineering, it's no surprise that you will become a sociopath. If you consider yourself masochist, then this game is absolutely recommended. Hedonists will have to look elsewhere...
