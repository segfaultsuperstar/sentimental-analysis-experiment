This game is buggy and broken. Rockstar is and always will be hacks. Since day one. They don't make games. The make controversy and attention. That's all. What a slothing bunch of disgusting hacks. Just like most developers out there. Pathetic children crying at the whim of the publisher. Waaah, I need more time. Waah, what if we can't get our game published oh god. We must halt production. You weak pathetic fools. Make a good game that kicks ass and blows everyone out of the water than publishers will suck your balls. You're in control! ... This is exactly how not to make a game. It was a good idea like 10 years ago. Now it's an old idea with better graphics. What a telling sign of what's wrong with the industry. This game was rushed out by uncaring and lazy people. Period. A new low in gaming history.
