Who does Rockstar think they are ? Why did they say before the release of GTA 4 that even a 3yr old machine would run it ? Now when the game has gone banana, they are backtracking on their promise.Stupid cowards.They dont even have the courage to admit their mistake.Maybe it doesnt matter to them since we, the gamers are the biggest losers.How dare they tell us now that people with current and updated systems would have to run the game in medium settings.A machine which ran Fallout 3, Far Cry 2, Crysis Warhead on maximum settings with 40-50fps cant even run it properly on low settings. What a shame!!!!!!!!!!   I am not going to be forced by them to change to Quad core or whatever just because these Rockstar guys wants us to.The game is excellent but its not even worth wasting your money on better machine when its not good enough to run machine way beyond its recomended specs.A total failure from a coward developer.
