I can now play and am enjoying GTAIV PC   I updated my graphics drivers and deployed the patch from Rockstar and it is working.   I give the game a 10 for fun and a 1 for the installation nightmare and gameplay bugs out of the box (or in my case "Steam") for an overall score of 5.5   ...Oh, and still curious if anyone has ever received a refund from Steam for any reason?   ORIGINAL POST:  I have a brand new Gateway laptop that plays S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and Bioshock perfectly.  I cannot get GTA IV to load textures.  So it is unplayable.  I reviewed this game a couple weeks ago saying the same thing and just got a letter from Gamespot telling me I had violated their TOS.  (I have no idea why, they did not tell me any specifics... very strange) They removed my review, so am posting it again. Maybe they feel I do not have a right to review a game that I cannot get to run?  I guess that is a point, however, I just want to warn anyone with a Gateway FX laptop with 8800M GTS NVIDIA® GeForce® Go graphics card that you also may not be able to run the game.  You will not see any textures.  I bought the game on Steam, has anyone ever had success getting a refund from them? By the way, I have always played and enjoyed all previous GTA games for the PC.  Was looking forward to this one.  I will keep my fingers crossed for Mafia 2.
