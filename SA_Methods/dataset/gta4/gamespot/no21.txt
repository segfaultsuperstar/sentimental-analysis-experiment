Cant say how disapointed i got with this game. I has the graphics of a 2006 game, and requires a fully patched up 3-sli computer to look like it. Story is irrelivant at this point, how many gangster games are out there anyway? Options menu is totally wasted, nothing changable in it, if you dont have a powerful enough computer for it. And what the hell takes up all that space it requires anyway? Fully overrated. Definitely. There is nothing more to say. I'm giving it a 1.0 for being the game with the bigest name being the biggest disapointment on the PC. This game is far from becoming something big for mainstream gamers, unlike its predecessor, this cannot be played unless you have a power plant at home. It's even boring story-wise. So american, it brings nothing new to the community apart from a world where you can do a lot of stuff... if you have the right computer for it.
