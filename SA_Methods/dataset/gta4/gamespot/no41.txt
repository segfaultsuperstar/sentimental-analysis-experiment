Havn't encountered a technical nightmare like this in about ten years. First the game is unplayable, plagued with program loops, crashes and poor performance and second, windows sp3 required for the game to even work, had crippled my pc. So it looks like im out another $50 plus the time spent rolling everything back before sp3.    So, not only do i have to wait for a patch for GTA4 but, also sp3. I might not be able to play this game for months. Which means i'll be wait til after Xmas for some patch to come along.This really puts a damper on my holiday.   I use to think buying games, over downloading a shared copy was the right thing to do. Situations like this really make me regret spending  money on these games. This is the second game this winter i have that, i payed full price and can't play.
