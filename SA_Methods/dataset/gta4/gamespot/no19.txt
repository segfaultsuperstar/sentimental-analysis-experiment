I will start off by trying to refresh peoples memories about  the GTA Franchise, which most of us ALL fell in Luv with and  began to anticipate the release of Future release of GTA IV.    However GTA IV is a "Door stop" for the progress of the GTA Franchise.    Game Spot were Certainly offered  Favours to give this Game such a High Rating!    GTA IV  is By Far the Worst GTA ever Made! and this is due to One very simple reason, which is GTA IV is the Worst port I have ever come across in my entire  life.   Endless Bugs! Crashes, Glitches, Slowdowns, Erratic, Incompatibilities, errors , errors and errors, performance issues, Crashes, memory leaks, stutters, I think you get the idea.    GTA IV is a game that is simply spoiled by performance issues.   If you have an Intel Quad Core @ 3Ghz and 280 Gtx  then you will enjoy the game   Else   Save your Pocket Money and Skip this one
