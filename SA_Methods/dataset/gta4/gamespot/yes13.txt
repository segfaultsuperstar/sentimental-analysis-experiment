I bought this game the day it came out, expecting alot. GTAIV was a good game- for a while, After about 10 hours, I was wondering if there was going to be anything else to the game besides just free-roaming and doing missions. No, there is next to nothing worth noting about innovation with Grand Theft Auto 4. San Andreas was better than this game by far. I swear, Saints Row is better than this game. Pick it up if you're a die-hard fan only, because this is just another game for the Xbox 360 that had some potential and then blew it. F--- this game. k here im just wasting text so gamespot will publish it- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
