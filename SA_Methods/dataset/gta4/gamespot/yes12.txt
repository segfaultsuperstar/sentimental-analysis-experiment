Anyone playing this game is sure to come across the graphics issues. The shadows flicker and are completely annoying. I'm running a dual-quad core Xeon with Radeon HD 4800 and the game flows great, but textures are missing on certain angles and the shadows are like dark strobe lights!   I will say the story line is cool, and really enjoy the gameplay, but I'm sorry to say the graphics issues really just make this a non-playable game! Depending on the angle of my view, some obstacles do not show up and my car crashes into them. It's like my car crashed into nothing until I adjust the angle of the view and then I see it was a legit object.   How can they release this and not hang their heads in shame? I sure hope they release a patch to fix these problems... and quickly! Waste of $49.99. Developers - please just wait to release a quality product instead of rushing crap out to meet holiday season.
