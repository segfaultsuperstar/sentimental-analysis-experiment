GTA 4 is just a rip off of Vice city.   The only thing the developers have done is improved the graphics(Which also has a lot of FPS issues no matter how good your hardware is.).Massive modifications to the gameplay make this the worst GTA ever.     For me,GTA has always been about killing and torturing civilians on the street,Setting cops on fire and having fun while trying to evade the 6 star wanted level,Riding around in a tanker destroying nearby cars and Laugh loudly at the helplessness of the cops as they try to arrest you.   Unfortunately,You cannot do any of that in GTA 4.The police in the game have been overpowered and will react faster even if you fire  a pistol / steal a car.   The wanted level stars increase at a rapid rate.Some of the cops are armed with Mavericks and SMG's.Backup's arrive immediately for the cops that die and this is very annoying for players who are just trying to have some fun.   Jets and a lot of trademark GTA cars have been removed from the game,a LOT of weapons from previous GTA versions are also removed which further degrades the game.You can no longer get  a tattoo,Pimp your car,Indulge in gang wars,Go to the gym to get some muscle,Get a hair cut,Take over rival gang territories,drive a train,gamble in a casino,Buy a house Or even drive a taxi,ambulance or cop car to make money.    The story makes no sense whatsoever.One of the worst GTA games in history.I want to play gta 1 instead of GTA 4.Driving around in circles in gta 4 isn't exactly my idea of fun.There are no more bigger than life characters(Not just the lead role but also the side roles) in this story.   I am very disappointed with this game,I don't want to play liberty city stories either.Hopefully the next GTA game will be based more on the lead set by san andreas and will help us to forget GTA 4 as a bad nightmare.
