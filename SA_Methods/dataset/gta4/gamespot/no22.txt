GTA 4 for PC is a waste of money, and a POS. It's predecessors (GTA2, Vice City, and San Andreas) were known not only for their brilliance of gameplay, but also the ease of loading and playing on an "averagely" good PC. It takes forever to load, and when it finally does, you're subjected to a frame rate that is akin to trying to drive a car with half of its spark plug wires disconnected and 80% of the air let out of its tires. I'm running a Quadcore 2.4 w/ 4 gig memeory and a GeForce 8500, so it's not like I've got some tired old PC.  Every other new release I have (Crysis, Fallout 3, Call of Duty: World at War, and NFS:UC) runs like a champ.  Rockstar has taken the best game ever and totally peed in the face of the PC contingent with abysmal frame rates. Hey RS, put out a real patch to fix this female canine or send me back $50. Unplayable, and unforgivable...
