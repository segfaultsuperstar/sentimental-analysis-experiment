Grand Theft Auto has always been a game that focus on an unique story line and that was what captured all the original fans. However, what was special about this piece is that it didn't need much to run on a PC. Now comes along Grand Theft Auto 4 and it is, believe me, a piece of hard alien rock that hardly any PC can handle within reasonable set up specifications. Now I understand many people have already said this, but I am going to maybe extend this a little bit more:   Think about GTA 4 in the console versions: XBOX 360, PS3. All those run perfectly fine with no problem. But, given that a console is only a mid-range powerful PC. Now a high-end PC can't even run GTA 4 in highest settings?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?? Makes no sense.   Only explanation? Poor programming styles and bad optimization of algorithms they used to make the game; and here are some I've observed from the game but not verified in the source code since I don't have it:                     1. Memory leaks - Noob mistakes in programming that either leave dangling pointers or did not use "free()" to free up memory space that are not needed - making run-time stack full or mostly full.                    2. Poor game data structure design and algorithms - they probably did not spent enough time to develop a run-time efficient data structure and algorithm. Specifically, I suspect that Rock-Star did not use divide-and-conquer  (recursion) as much as they should of have, and instead they used mainly iteration (loops) which made a significant impact on CPU usage.                  3. Glitchy Textures - Sometimes when the camera is quickly turned (like swing your mouse quickly) textures are not properly loaded at some angles! In fact, they are not loaded at some angles leaving a colored polygon surface.               4. Film-grain like shadows - The shadows are drawn onto any surface with bad quality! I think this might be a round-off error used in the implementation of the render-er.         I know the game's story is capturing and the game plays have been improved ALOT compared to the last game. However, all these software performance issues are simply unbearable and unforgivable. I mean RockStart has only an average game engine to begin with compared to CryEngine 2, and they are forcing "good quality" on a poor engine and noob programmers. Lastly, here is my bench mark for GTA 4...and my System can run Crysis at 1680X1050 with 8XAA and V-Sycn with everything on High setting (no ultra high cuz don't have dx10)   Statistics  Average FPS: 35.33  Duration: 37.33 sec  CPU Usage: 88%  System memory usage: 49%  Video memory usage: 79%   Graphics Settings  Video Mode: 1680 x 1050 (60 Hz)  Texture Quality: Medium  Render Quality: Very High  View Distance: 46  Detail Distance: 100   Hardware  Microsoft Windows XP Professional  Service Pack 3  Video Adapter: ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series  Video Driver version: 6.14.10.6879  Audio Adapter: Realtek HD Audio output  Intel Pentium III Xeon processor   File ID: benchmark.cli   which Crysis is only using 60 - 70% of CPU -.- this is stupid....
