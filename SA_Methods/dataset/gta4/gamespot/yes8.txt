When I started playing this game I was really excited. I played San Andreas, Vice City, GTA3 and all the others. But... This game is so much overrated I can't find words to describe it. And I'll tell you why.    First, the map. Yep. It's so small that every damn mission you're doing makes you go through the same streets. You'll probably see everything and get tired of seeing everything you can in a couple of hours of gameplay. This makes me sad. San Andreas, for PS2, had a much bigger map, and this is just sad for a PS3/360 game.   Second, the missions. Ok. Kill that guy. Pursue that car. Break into that building. Ok. Now what? Kill that guy. Ok. Kill that guy. Break into that building. You got it right? Where are all those cool missions from the past games? You know, those mission can look dumb but it prevents you from getting sick of kills, kills, kills... By the end of the game I was so sick of this I didn't even care much for story, I just wanted to end this.   Third, customization. San Andreas = tattoos, gym, hair, beard, clothes. GTA IV = clothes. How can a game for the PS3 can be so far from a game for the PS2 in this? I just don't get it.   Fourth, use of money. What the hell money in this game is used for? Nothing. You can't even buy hideouts like ALL the other games in the series since GTA3. By the end of the game you'll have all the weapons, all the clothes and millions of dollars for nothing. Just sad.   Of course there are some pros, but just the usual GTA stuff.    In the end all I can say is that if you're looking for the real GTA games go check on San Andreas and you'll be much happier, trust me.
