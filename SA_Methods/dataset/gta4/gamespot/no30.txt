First thing first,how can it be that this game works on PlayStation with no problems and still looking beautiful!? But on my pc which is dual core 5.6 Ghz, Ge-force 8600 Gts,  4Gb Ram, looks like a bad dream!because all settings are on low and they cant be changed...  .  Obviously "Rock-star" collected lots of money from consoles and now they are collecting it form Big companies to make this game buggy and with abnormal system requirements just to sell hardware...  Not to mention all the incredible stupid things like Social Club i have to go trough just to play the game!  You should be shame of yourself "Rock-Star",you just lost a costumer for life!  Now i am going to delete this crap form my hard disk and now i am waiting for saints row 2.hope they wont make same mistake.  I waited this game for so long to come to PC and finally now when it is here all i see is big screw up!
