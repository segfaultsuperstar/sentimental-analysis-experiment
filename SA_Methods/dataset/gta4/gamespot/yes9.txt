First of all. I like gta series in general. I think they are fun games, with nice storyline and all that good stuff.  Now gta 4 is obviusly most anticipated game since forever and of course i expected a lot from it. Not to mention that 70% of sites gave it perfect score.  But seriusly whats up with that?? This game is boring! I would rather trade metallica tickets for a jonas brothers concert than play this ever again....  So whats bad with this game? The missions- they are boring as hell, the most fun thing about them are the cutscenes because they are different all the time, unlike the missions. Here is a standard boring gay-ass gta 4 mission: You have to pick up a friend who is on the other side of town, kill 3 dudes, escape from police, get back to your house. Now that was fun the first time around but when you figure out that  most of the missions are like this it wont be so much fun. Not to mention that there is about 100 missions. Nice job rockstar.  Only memorable mission is when you are on a truck and you get into it. It is the only mission i remeber from the whole game!   Now other stuff aint that bad. Nice graphics, voice acting, characters- but I dont care about that, i want to have fun!  Oh yeah, you can only choose from 3 t shirts and pants. Have fun making your character a little bit your own.  Theres no tanks, no tattos, no weapon upgrades and all that good stuff.   The story is promising at first but gets all gay with people betraying you all over the place, you know standard **** every gta game is the same.   Oh yeah. I understand serbian, even tho I aint serbian. And when the voice actor said something on serbian he sucked so **** hard, that was some of the better moments of the whole game.   Give me as much thumbs down you want all you fanboys!
