Been a gta fanboy since it originally came out on the pc as a 2d top down action driver (yes that is right console boyz - do your history)   since then gta vice / san have been 'ok' ports ...but this is shocking  it came out a while ago that rockstar are only interested in making good console versions due to downloaded rips of the game on torrents - and it shows   in a bid to stop piracy they have gone windows live ... i.e you can only save ur progress if you have 'live'   lets break it down shall we -    windows live = internet connection  no internet connection  = no saves  no saves = unplayable   I LIVE ON A UK - AND ALONG WITH 40.000 PLUS SERVING PERSONNEL-MOST LIVING ON CAMPS  WITHOUT INTERNET CONNECTION - THANKS ROCKSTAR!   thanks also to 'gears of war' 'bioshock' 'half life 2' etc that use live   ALL YOUR GAMES HAVE BEEN SENT BACK TO THE SHOP AND DOWNLOADED OFF TORRENTS - FÂ£$K YOU!   just like microsoft - you are actually hurting the buying public by your actions rather than the torrent boys.    AND NO I AM NOT GOING TO BUY A PS3/XBOX JUST TO PLAY YOUR GAME WHEN MY PC IS FASTER THAN BOTH PUT TOGETHER - WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY FOR A CRAPPER VERSION. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PC GAMERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
