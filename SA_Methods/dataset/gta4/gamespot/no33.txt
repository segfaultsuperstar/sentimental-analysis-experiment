The overall game play of this game is amazing. The story, style, controls are all up to par and could easily give this game a 10/10. The problem is that if you are a high end pc gamer get ready to be pissed. I was running a quad core 2.8 ghz, asus 9600 gts in sli, 4 gigs ram and the problems I've had are ridiculous. my system easily pumps out games such as fallout 3, crysis, and far cry on high/very high as 1440 x 900 resolution. When ti comes to this game its like reverting back to oldies such as counterstrike and original half life. I'm forced to play in the range on low/mid and even then i'm getting very bag fps drops down to the 10's. Theres some small artifacting going on in the distance and the game crashes at least once a hour. Now include, securom crap and Microsoft live force saves and this game is pitiful. I highly doubt the writer of the reviewer on gamespot even played this game or he would be dropping that 9.0/10 in a heartbeat. When rockstar has to go plead to nividia and ati to help get a new driver out that would help the problems in the game then somethings terribly wrong.
