When I played the first GTA I was in high-school. Me and my friends used gather in one of our rooms and have fun four hours without being aware how many had passed.   When GTA III was released, I felt like I had to change my agenda. That was a new thrill and I remember my excitement buying new hardware just to stray that immense environment.   I played San Andreas twice, finished the whole scenario and b-sides in both of them.   I had been waiting for GTA IV to be out on the market since I heard its news.   _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._    I played the game on my friends X360 , it was nice. The city, the liveliness, the diversity of the NPC's on the roads.   Everything seemed perfect, except that annoying camera angle problem.  _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._ _._    Yet, this is a review on how the game is on PC.   2 words: IT SUCKS!   I was really "DISAPPOINTED" by the rushed work of ROCKSTAR. I hope they are aware of this failure and they are planning a fix.   A slightly older game Mass Effect has better graphics and much lower requirements. This is because the games' engine adjusts itself to the hardware you own.   I was going to rate this game with a "2", but my "hopes and expectations" that ROCKSTAR will find a cure to this disease raised my rating by 2. I'll wait and see what "revelations" will emerge after these "black-holes" of game porting failures.
