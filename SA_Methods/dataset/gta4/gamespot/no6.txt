Research on the net before buying this game. Bad port simply based on the insane amount requirements to get it running. You may be one of the lucky ones to get it running, but if you do some research there are many that simply could not get the game running due to bugs, glitches, errors. Not to mention the insane requirements to get the game to even launch. Even today there are still people buying the game and posting on forums all over with issues just trying to get the game to launch. I bought the game and wasted 2 days trying to get it to launch and gave up over the frustration. This is the only game I bought and never played due to a poorly done port. Considering my rig can install and play Crysis and Fallout in short order and also play on max settings without stupid and insane requirements before I can launch a game only shows rockstar blew it big time for it's pc gamer following.   You've been warned......
