GTAIV looked really good, and when I saw the 10 from Gamespot i was thinking two things. Either it was really good, or GameSpot got caught up in the hype and gave it a good score. It turned out to suck and they got a good score. The graphics are no where near superb, at least compared to other next-gen games. The driving is fun, and once you FINALLY get guns its fun too. But it all gets old. Same stuff over and over again. Its only in 3rd person which sucks for shooting, so a no no there. Also, saving is horrible. Games that dont let you save almost anywhere are completely idiotic because it neither adds challenge or fun by making you save only after completing a mission or going to your house. The only time it actually is ok is in first-person shooting MISSION games, which this is not one.  If you like games with good stories and games that lead you to new places, then you probably wont like this game. Maybe I was so disappointed because it received a 10, but to be honest, I just didnt like it much at all and I probably wont play it for a long time.
