The main thing to keep in mind is that a 10 is perfection, yet people admit there are multiple flaws in the game and give it a 10 anyways. That is called fanboyism, and while the game is good - it isn't a 10.   I do not think this game deserves a 10 there were so many things left out I am so disappointed. Rock star has totally left the door open for Saints Row 2 to come in and knock this tittle off its false throne. I mean come there were things left out like customizing cars, skydiving, airplanes and why when your online in free mode you can't go to the strip club with your buddies online there are no strippers in there. I bought the collectors that cost 80$ and you should have got something exclusive to play online with only if you bought the collectors edition what's up with that. I'm second guessing buying collectors edition for any games for now on. I'm really looking forward to Saints Row it looks like there going to bring it on this one besides the last one was a 10 it had everything. So we will see what happens when this occurs, but hopefully another game will show up the reviewers who give it a "10".
