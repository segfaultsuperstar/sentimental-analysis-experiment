GTA 4 has less content, (included on launch) less activities, less character, worse music than any of the previous editions. And what IS there is pointless distractions.  Theres no jet packs, kill frenzies or FUN frankly.  the friends are time wssting chores, and the multiplayer is horrible to access. the menus and lobbies are awful. and the game modes, rather than being something unique to GTA like robbing banks or using the map in some uniquie way (you could have cab wars, where each team has to drive passnegers around and rob each others business....culmiating in a turf war!) all the modes are bog standard racing / deathmatch types. cops and robbers is just an objective deathmatch.   very disappointing and anyone who says otherwise has no imaginination.   in brief theyve stretch themselves too far and excelled at nothing. where saints row 2 was funny and had content that made you smile, everything theyve done to gta 4 makes you think, why did they do this? OR, why di they take THAT out? ive no idea why so many people rate this so highly when graphics aside its a step back in every department.  the multplayer could have been the money shot but no. its boring.  saints row 2 had co-op for the WHOLE GAME for goodness sake and a multplayer mode which, although I didint like it much, at least it tried some new things.....   only kids think gta 4 is brilliant.  if im wrong why was no one playing it 6 months afterward?   rockstar are kings of marketing and the fact you cant post negative comments on links to GTA5 content on this site proves it. they sell on hype rather than content.
