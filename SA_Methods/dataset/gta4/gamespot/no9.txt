I absolutely can not stand when they make a game way to hard for recreational gamers to play . the ballad of gay tony is  in a word gay i made it to the part where you have to steal a helicopter that you need to be a hard core gamer to control , had to retry the mission 20 times.could not learn how to pilot the helicopter. i will never play the game anymore.their was no reason to make controlling a helicopter that hard. i am very good a a wide range of games.and it really pissed me off when rock star took a game that was to be fun for all kinds of gamers and made it so you have to be a advanced gamer.their was no reason to do that with grand theft auto. the ballad of gay tony is a complete wast of money and time for gamers that are not prodigy children when it comes to your skills as a gamer. I can see games like that being made for people that are, but not with a game that all types of skill level gamers have  player for years.
