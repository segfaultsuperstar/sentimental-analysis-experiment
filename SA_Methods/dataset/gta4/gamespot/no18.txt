BORING.    good storyline however..but BORING gameplay.  The missions difficulty levels are just right.. but again..  there is this DEEP sense of BORING throughout the game.  The sign up process takes hours and you need to open  more than one account.  And you need to be signed in  to two acouunts just to play a ....game.   New York.... is very impressively modeled...and  its a good way to view New York virtually, but its much  better just to go to New York and drive a real car  and take a real subway.  Is this a virtual recreation  (better if its free and online) or....a game?  Music: okay, the Ranetki girls are shining.  The radio  stations are excellent.  They did  a very very good job with the music, it reminds me  of the good good FUN Gta 3.  The cab rides are an excellent addition and a great  way to view the city and take a break.  My computer was able to run the game ...you know...  just good enough. Remember playing gta 3 on your  old puter? sigh,,... same thing. You need to use  2012 computers to run this thing. But again...this  was not a big problem for me.(dual 2.0, 512 nvidia and 2 gig ram)  It seems that they perfected the state of this type of game..  but forgot to make it FUN and maybe they forgot that  its just a game.  Youve already proved ....youre..legit....I hope that  this is your dark peak and now..back to games.  Im looking forward to Chinatown wars.
