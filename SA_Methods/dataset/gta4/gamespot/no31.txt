I'm reviewing GTA 4 PC version here. Repeat: PC VERSION! The only reason why Gamespot gave this a 9.0 score and some other reviewers rate this game above 1.0 is because their judgement is based on the console versions:  Needless to say GTA 4 is a great game. In fact, it's personally the best of the GTA series.   However, no matter how good a game is, it's worthless if you can't play it. First I thought it was my PC, but after reading Gamespots review, going through the forums here and trying it out on different systems, I must say that the game is simply a lousy port. If not THE most lousy port.   As Gamespot has already reviewed, the game runs terribly even on systems that far exceed the recommended requirements. Sure, it runs, but at far lower resolutions and with far lower settings than it's console counterparts.  Then there's the fact that no gamepads other than the Xbox controller will work. After that, the whole Windows LIVE thing is just minuscule.   Bottom line:   GTA 4 on consoles: Game of the Year  GTA 4 on PC: Shame of the Year
