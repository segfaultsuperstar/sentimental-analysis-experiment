Wow!!! just... wow!!! a new gta comes and i was so happy because when i was little i used to play and enjoy so much these series but then Nico belic came and f****ed up my dream of a game. gamespot why 10?????? why??? Lets start with first impressions, you start the game into a character that is a total disapointment, yeah right he looks like a criminal alright but give the player a chance to customize a little(like srinking his nose a bit :P) Now what about the storyline?? What storyline??It didnt keep my intrest at all... yeah voiceovers and cutscreens worked kinda good but it wasnt the perfect job was needed to be done.Face motion with details missing from a game which took 10/10? A have to say the gameplay was practical enough and the graphics in the city and all the cars were well made and thats the reason i put 6 on this game. There are no chalenges and no point in this, just hurry up and finish a boring story. I played Saints Row 2 which was way better and more intresting than gta 4, yeah it lacks in graphics and controls but it entertains the gamer... developers take a look at san adreas and create something worth our cash cause next time i wont buy a box of s**t cause it wrights GTA on it.
