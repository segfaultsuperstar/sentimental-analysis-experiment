This game was a major letdown. I have hardware above the recommended specs with all the latest drivers  yet I can barely even play it, even with everything on low. Most of the time it gets really buggy just in the menu screen. Read the GTA Forums. There are many people in the same boat. There is no reason to have such high graphics requirements. They could have just ported it directly over and most people wouldn't have cared. At the most they could have made additional settings so that the user can set his own graphics settings. The requirement to install the Rockstar Social Club and Windows Games Live programs is pathetic especially for those that just want to play a single player game. These additional programs just use up more of your RAM better spent on the game itself. There is no way this game should have passed beta testing and yet here it is. I feel cheated.
